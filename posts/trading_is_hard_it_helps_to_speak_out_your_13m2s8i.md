This market is hard - there is no denying that. But what makes it harder is not having someone you can talk to. Trading can be extremely stressful - and many people, especially beginners, can get extremely down on themselves. Some feel like failures, and others lose so much money they don't know what to do. We aren't psychologists, or psychiatrists, or anything professional -- but we are still people and we'd like to help somehow.  

We're starting a new section in the RDT discord (for ease of management). A channel will be created where members can post a new thread and simply vent, or to ask for guidance in what they can do. It can be helpful to see that you're not alone. 

We're also aware that this can be deeply personal, so you are also free to DM someone here so you can have a private 1:1 talk. We hope that this is something that will be beneficial to our members here at RDT - let's get through this market together. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

Here are some resources that we've compiled: 

* 998 is for the suicide and crisis lifeline - available 24 hours and is also available for Spanish speakers
*  Depending on where you are, there are local hotlines you can call as well. [Findahelpline.com](http://findahelpline.com/) is an online resource you can use to help narrow down where you can call 
* Therapy is also quite useful - although you can find someone for 1:1, not all of us have this opportunity. Youtube is a good place to start listening - personally, [u/5xnightly](https://www.reddit.com/user/5xnightly) has had experience with Dr. Andrew Menaker and recommends starting there. 

We will continually update this as needed in order to expand the resources. 

We are starting a channel within the RDT discord (#health-mindset-support) where people can go to just talk to someone, if needed. To keep it a little more focused, we are locking it so only individuals who ping a mod can be added to a specific group that allows posting in that channel.

A mod or verified trader or intermediate trader will be there to listen.

Again, we are not professionals, but most traders know what it feels like to be struggling. Let's get through this.
