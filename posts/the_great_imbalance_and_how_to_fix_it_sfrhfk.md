Understanding the imbalance that exists between losing traders and winning traders is essential to becoming successful.

As has been stated many times, on the face of it, there is no statistical reason why most traders should lose money.  As despite popular belief, there is no built-in edge against you.

The only times when there is a built-in statistical disadvantage to an individual is when the opposing side has an inherent edge, such as in casino games.  The *game itself* is statistical in favor of the *house.* Which is why that despite sometimes thinking they can overcome that edge, gamblers go into those games relying on luck to get them over the *House Advantage*.

Now you might be thinking - *What about when the the opposing side of transaction has access to elements/information that you do not yourself?*

Yes, true, there is a fine line here, because while *insider information* obviously falls under this, so does data that can be obtained for purchased.  One type of advantage is illegal and highly regulated, and the other is simply out of your financial reach.    Still, even though this information gives Institutions an *edge* there is absolutely nothing forcing you to take the other side of their "bet".  In other words, just because they have the power to get an edge for *themselves* they are not the *house*, you can just as easily play on the same side as them.  Imagine you were sitting next to a professional card counter at a Blackjack table - just because they have an edge, doesn't mean it hurts you - in fact, you could easily just follow their bets (as the primarily edge card counters have is in the ability to adjust their betting size based on the remaining composition of the deck(s) ).

So the *Great Imbalance* isn't in the access to information Institutions have - it is in the fact that despite there being no inherent *house* edge, well over 50% of traders lose money.  How can that be?

You will find the answer in the *Walk-A-Away* analysis I developed, and suggested everyone do at least once a week.  

Because as long as you have some inkling of what you are doing, then burn this fact into your brain:

***Almost all of your picks are winners - it is just a matter of WHEN*****.**  

So why aren't they winning? Three things are stopping your trades from being profitable in this case:

**1)** ***Options*** \- Options have a time-limit on them, and the more you wait, the less they are worth.  

**2)** ***Impatience -*** Exiting potentially winning positions because you panic-sold.

**3)** ***Buying Power*** *-* Your position size was too large and thus holding onto the trade would lock-up your account from making any other plays.

If you went back one year, take any given week and looked at your trades (sort of a *long-term Walk Away Analysis),* whether or not they were Options, look at the entry price on each, and whether it was long or short.

*Now look to see - how many of those trades became profitable* **at some point** *over the past year? Chances are it will be over 95%.*  

***And that is where the imbalance lies.***  

However, we are short-term traders, and thus aren't in the business of holding positions for months at a time.  So how do we mitigate against this?  How do we correct this imbalance without simply only buying stock and just *waiting it out*?

Everything taught in this sub is meant to do just that - reduce the window of "***when***" and there is no **single** thing that does it - 

\- *A strong corresponding Daily chart* 

\- *Relative Strength or Weakness to the Market*

\- *Accurate read on the Market itself*

\- *Knowing what is noise and what is the signal*

\- *Understanding the overall story of the chart*

All of these combine to help reduce the amount of time it takes before your trade is proven correct.  As in order for you to be profitable it needs to be proven correct *within* the window of time necessary. 

The key here is to understand that these elements do not **stand alone** and *must* be looked at in combination.  Nor do they all have equal contribution.  For example, you can have four of the five checked off, but if your read on the market is incorrect, the trade will most likely, simply not work.

I see countless posts here that say, "I went long on a stock with *Relative Strength*, and then the RS faded and I wound up losing.  What am I missing here?"  (btw - a tip, don't say *What am I missing?* in a sardonic manner, because I assure you that **you are in fact missing something**).  Without faily, when I look at the trades, they were either against the market overall, or the person exited prematurely, etc.

**Time** is the great equalizer.  Given enough of it, a vast majority of your trades are profitable.  Given too little and an equally large majority are not.  In order to mitigate against that element you need *all* the help you can get.  

Before entering a trade you need to know - 

*Do I have a sense on where the market is and where it might be headed, both immediately and in the near future?*

*Does the Daily chart of my trade correspond to the direction of my trade and the market itself?  How strong is that agreement?*

*Is my trade in line with the market itself?*

*How strong/weak is my stock against the market (i.e. SPY)? On a 5-minute basis? On a daily basis?*

*What is my overall thesis for this trade and can I withstand the noise that may push against the boundaries of the thesis?*

These are the questions you must know the answer to before entering a trade.  With experience comes the ability to formulate these answers quickly, but without experience it demands that a trader *slow down and take the time to go through each.*

While this post does not introduce any new concepts, it also gets right to the core of why traders have such a difficult time maintaining profitability.  

Either way, I hope it helps!

 Best, H.S.
