As many of you know I am in the middle of the $5K Challenge, in which I am using a $5K Margin-Enabled Account, that has 3 Day Trades every 5 Days, and attempting to double it.  Previously I was able to complete this challenge in 3 Days with 21 total trades.  When I did the first challenge, we had a Bullish Market that was in a strong trend which allowed me to use a very straightforward method.

However, this challenge has been very different.  While the volatility is great for Day Trading, these past two weeks have created one of the most difficult Swing Trading environments of recent memory.

The entire exercise is meant to be a teaching tool, so in that respect I am using every single "trick" in the book to help people learn how to manage their positions.  Everything from simply selling calls/puts over my long positions to generate buying power to exploiting the flaw in brokers that allow you to close a position even if it puts one into a negative account balance (i.e. if I wanted to get calls on *TSLA*, but did not have the buying power, one could do a *CDS*, wait for *TSLA* to dip, buy back the short call for a profit which would put the account into a "Margin Call", and then hold the long calls that I wouldn't have been able to get otherwise. You then close the position the next day to avoid the margin call).  

There are many different methods one can use to increase a small account, in this post I am outlining four of the most prominent.  The current environment allows for two different strategies:

*Current Method - Balanced with Specs*:  

For this method I use every single dime of buying power.  

The best way to illustrate that is to outline the current account which has $3,698 in total balance at the moment.

***Positions:*** 

**Bearish:**

*FDX -* Currently representing - $1,378 in value, was purchased for $819 (which is $559 in profit)

*FSIV -* Currently representing - $666 in value (funny), was purchased for $562 (which is $104 in profit)

***Total spent on Bearish Positions = $1,381.  Current Value of Bearish Positions = $2,044, which is 55.2% of the portfolio.***

**Bullish:**

*BKR -* Currently representing - $442 in value, was purchased for $375 (which is $67 in profit)

*PM -*  Currently representing $400 in value, was purchased for $302 (which is $98 in profit)

*SNAP -* Currently representing $309 in value, was purchased for $636 (which is $327 in losses)

*CFVI -* Currently representing - $210 in value, was purchased for $280 (which is $70 in losses)

*OXY -* Currently representing - $159 in value, was purchased for $147 (which is $12 in profit)

***Total spent on Bullish Positions = $1,740.  Current Value of Bullish Positions = $1,520, which is 41.1% of the portfolio.***

**Spec:**

*BHG -* Currently representing - $163 in value, was purchased for $80 (which is $83 in profit)

*BBIG -* Currently representing - $30 in value, was purchased for $40 (which is $10 in losses)

***Total spent on Spec Positions = $120.  Current value of Spec Positions = $193, which is 5.2% of the portfolio.***  

\*\****The $55.47 disparity is due to the settling of Options in the account; thus, the total adds up to 101.5%.\*\****

As you can see this method is one of balance - using *Relative Strength* and *Relative Weakness*.  If the market opens down on Monday, the *Bullish* positions (due to their *Relative Strength*) should hold, or even increase given their concentration in the *Oil Sector*.  And if the market open higher, the *Bearish* positions have a cushion, which combined with their *Relative Weakness* should be able to maintain their profitable status.

This approach however generally does not allow for *large gains*, but it offers protection in a volatile market.  It is not *hedged* but rather *balanced*.  The *Spec* trades (low risk, high potential reward) are used to allow for the chance of a large potential gain.  If, for example, *BHG* were to go over $4, those calls which cost $80 total, would surge in value to well over $500.

Balanced approaches such as this require a constant monitoring and updating of the account.  You may notice that it is slightly tilted towards a *Bearish* edge (55.2% of the total value), which is reflective of the current market.  The *Bullish* positions have options that are *sector* dependent, which may change quickly.  ***In other words, you are constantly monitoring and trading this type of account!***

Throughout this challenge my positions at the end of each day generally bore little resemblance to its' composition at the open of the market.  One also needs to maximize every penny of their buying power, as well as be as flexible as possible, given the restriction in Day Trades - a fine line to walk as a trader.  

It is very easy to make a mistake while executing this strategy (e.g. I sold *GPS Lottos* far too early as they would have paid off and brought the account close to $5K), or lose an opportunity given the market uncertainty (e.g. closing down the *ADBE* spread at the beginning of the day, which if allowed to run would have brought the account close to $5K).  

However, it is *also one of the best methods in which to teach small account management*.  There is no area of *short-term swing trade* that isn't covered here - from using spreads to straight options, hedging your positions and taking measured risks.

There of course, *another way,* which really is a matter of reduction and magnitude.  As I mentioned in the last video, this second way is not nearly as engaging as the one currently being employed, and it requires far less active management.  

Given the lack of market direction (unless *SPY* breaks through the upward sloping Algo-Trendline, in which case we will have a *Bearish* trend confirmed) - one simply maintains a balanced portfolio with less positions and higher concentration of funds.

For example - if on Monday I were to liquidate everything but the *FDX* spread and *PM* calls (using the money from the other positions to enter into 2 more calls on *PM*),and then letting both run - 

1) The *FDX* spread has an addition profit potential of $1,621 if *FDX* were to finish the week below $227.50, which is roughly $5 away from the current price. 

2) Four calls on *PM* is currently worth $800, a $1.50 increase in the price of *PM* would give an addition $400 in profit.

Having just those two positions and keeping the *Spec* of *BHG*, puts the account in place where it could be over $6,000 simply by having *FDX* go below $227.5, *PM* finishing about $109.50, and *BHG* climbing over $4.  Three *very likely scenarios.*  

The account would have roughly $1,400 in Buying Option available to make any adjustments.  The idea from then would be to always have:

1) **One Bearish Spread that can net over $1,000 in profit, finding the weakest stock in the weakest sector that is proportionally weak to SPY**

2) **A Bullish spread on the strongest stock in the strongest sector that is proportionally strong to SPY**

3) **One low cost** ***Spec*** **that can generate roughly $500 with a small move in the underlying - if you chose the right** ***Spec*** **stocks, these should pay off roughly 20% of the time.**

This method, as you might imagine, is not very exciting - however, as long as you adjust your positions each day given the state of the market (i.e. if the market start to become very bearish, you would increase the position size of the the *Bearish* spread and reduce the *Bullish* one) - this method should produce between $750-$1,500 in profit each week until you reached your goal.  Any pop in your *Spec* plays would cut a week off your time.

The other two methods, which are not viable in the current market, but would be if we had a shift in *SPY*, are very straightforward:

**Aggressive:**  Once a clear trend in *SPY* is confirmed, this method involves buying straight calls or puts on stocks that qualify under the conditions outlined in the Wiki.  This approach was used on the last Challenge, and resulted in a $10K account within 3 days.

**Conservative:**  This would require a clear finding of support from *SPY* and then a confirmed bounce, at which point you would enter *OTM Bullish Put Spreads* that net $1K in profit each at first.  To do this you would need to do either 10 contracts of $1 Credit, 20 Contracts of .50 Credit, or 50 Contracts of a .20 Credit - each would cost you $4,000 in margin to use and net $1,000 in profit.  The plays would average to be 3 weeks away in expiration and be *very high probability trades* (typically these spreads work 90-95% of the time, and allow for one to leg-out for breakeven or profit when they do not work, 1-2% of the time).  If you started with $4K (which is roughly where we are), one would reach their goal of $10K in roughly 10-12 weeks time (once you hit $6K you can do two spreads, one for $1,000 profit and one for $500, etc.).

As you follow along with this Challenge, keep these various methods in mind.  You will be able to clearly see which ones I am using as we continue to navigate the most unpredictable and volatile market in many years.

 

Best, H.S.
