*<Warning - Inspirational rant ahead>*

We all know there is a disconnect between *Wall Street*, which is constantly reaching new *all-time highs*, and *Main Street*, which is seems to be in a downward spiral.

So many people are currently out-of-work, or being forced to accept job well-below the levels that were at with their previous employer.  Many people have depleted their savings, and are genuinely worried about the future for themselves and their families.  It doesn't matter if you are just out of college and looking for a job, or postponing retirement because you just can't afford it, there is a widespread feeling of hopeless out there.  

No matter your political affiliation, one thing is clear - if you were wealthy, than over the last two years you got even wealthier, and if you weren't, you are most likely in a worse position today than you were just a short time ago.  

And we all grew up hearing the same advice - buy stock in solid companies, and build your investment portfolio.  Which is all well and good, except people need to eat, now and pay rent, now - not in thirty years.  

As a result, millions turned to the one place where there wasn't a gatekeeper to turn them away, the one place where they could rise or fall based solely on their own abilities - Trading.  *And what happened?*  

***The vast majority of them got wiped out.***  

What little savings they had were gone in the blink of an Out-Of-The-Money Call Option.   People got crushed both financial and emotionally.   *And why did this happen?*  

Because the moment you have a large number of people rushing into a space with money to spend, you also have a bunch of vultures ready to fleece them.  And fleece them they did.  

Whether it was through some false-guru on YouTube, promising that they can get rich and only have to work for one hour each day, or a bunch of uninformed gamblers convincing them to buy a Meme stock and then hold it - even if it went into profit - new traders didn't stand a chance.  Even the forums that tried to become somewhat legitimate quickly became filled with bad advice that wound up confusing and misleading even the sharpest amongst us.  

Due to all of this, total measure of economic injury caused to countless people was, and is, staggering.

*Short-Term* trading is unique.  Whether you start with a small account, or use a significant amount of capital, there exists a roadmap, that if navigated properly, can allow an individual to finally be free of a system that does not allow them to succeed.  It stands alone as a potential pathway to never having to worry about money again, all while being your own boss.  The promise of this reward is why people keep coming back again and again, hoping to get it right (or to at least get *lucky*).

Hence, this sub-Reddit was formed.  A small oasis, that existed for the sole purpose of actually helping those seeking a better life for themselves and their families. A place where people can actually learn this skill and reach the financial independence the field allows one to achieve.  

But I want more than that.  I want nothing less than to change the way trading is seen - I want to remove the stigma that the past few years has created and truly make this field what it is really is - *a viable and obtainable skillset that allows one to become financially independent.*  

Being a full-time Trader is a career, one of the best careers you can have, and it should be seen as such.  

I want the cultural conversation to go from:  "95% fail and the rest get lucky - it's all gambling and not something you can actually depend on to make a living" to "If you put the work and time in, you can become a consistently profitable full-time trader".  

Because once that happens, once that conversation shifts, it opens up an entire avenue to all those people that currently feel trapped.  

So I am happy this sub is helping so many become better traders, I see it everyday, and love every minute of it, and the more that happens the more this place will become the spark that spreads out and truly changes how trading is viewed.   

I want to thank you, all of you, for being part of this, and helping grow this community - we are doing something truly great here.  We will continue to grow, and help as many people as possible - something I can't do it without all of you. 

And anyone that doesn't believe this is possible, you send them here - send them to me, or just show them our Twitter account ( [https://twitter.com/RealDayTrading](https://twitter.com/RealDayTrading) ), where this week 53 straight winning trades were posted live, as they were made and exited. Ask them to explain how that is possible unless it is a learned skill, a skill that is obtainable to anyone that is willing to put in the work.   Which is why I post every trade I make in real-time, not so you can follow the trade, but to constantly show anyone willing to watch, that it is *Real.*  

Best, H.S.
