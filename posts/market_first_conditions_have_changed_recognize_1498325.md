The market broke through a major horizontal resistance level last week. This changes the backdrop and you need to adjust.

I don’t consider this a powerful breakout because we do not have heavy volume. When the market broke through this technical resistance last week we were looking for follow through. It was going to take time for the market to digest gains and even though we did not scream higher, the breakout had been holding. That was a bullish sign and I have been encouraging you to wait for support each day and to focus on the long side. Bullish markets establish the low of the day early and they close near the high.

Good shorts are very hard to find and bearish search results are lean. That is by design. When you are flipping charts and you can’t find a good short, it’s a sign to focus on the long side. Before the breakout we had mixed red and green candles on the SPY D1 chart and we did not know if the market was going to reverse off of resistance or breakout. At that time it was fine to day trade either side.

There are a dozen reasons to be bearish longer-term and I would have liked much better volume during this breakout, but the fact remains that we have a bullish breakout. Buyers have demonstrated that they are in control. Since the volume is light, we keep our trades shorter-term.

We are seeing rotation into small cap stocks and out of consumer staples. That is a sign of “risk on”. VIX/VXX has also been tanking and that is a sign that uncertainty is declining.

Swing traders can get more aggressive with overnight longs. Don’t “load up” on bullish positions, but have a few positions on.  You can be fairly confident that the bottom is not going to drop out overnight and that the odds favor a move up overnight. Two weeks ago, we did not have this backdrop and there were plenty of overnight gaps down that sucked the life out of bullish overnight positions. If you get a big overnight gap up, take gains on the swings knowing that the bid is going to be tested. This is not a “go-go” rally on heavy volume where you can ride longer term bullish swing trades.

Day traders need to avoid chasing stocks when the market gaps up. Be patient and know that the bid is going to be tested early in the day. That will give you time to evaluate the market and to find the strongest stocks. Once the market finds support, buy those stocks. Since the market breakout I’ve been telling you to watch for those early bid checks. This is one of those moments where your day trading strategy is one-sided. We have a nice bullish breakout so you should only be focusing on the long side. Until we see a long red D1 candle on SPY, we stick with bullish trades. When you start your day and you find strong stocks, start setting alerts and buy dips. I like using the Strong vs SPY M5 variable that is true and that needs to go false. When it goes true, the alert is triggered. Typically, the first move lower during the day is going to be your best opportunity to buy those stocks. If the market opens flat, there might not be much of a bid check. There are not any “oversize” overnight gains to digest and the market just starts grinding higher. Since the market did not gap up, we don’t have to worry that there are a lot of “fakes” in our bullish searches. You need to be cautious with stocks that have big overnight gaps up. Absolutely set the Strong vs SPY M5 alerts on these. You want to buy dips and you do not want to get trapped on a gap reversal. When the stock does dip, you want most of the gains to be preserved and ideally it does not retrace much below the VWAP. Anything more than that and the risk of the gap up reversing farther is high. Know that a SPY gap down is our best scenario. We have to wait for support. If overseas markets have been flat, the move lower is going to get gobbled up especially if it is less than 20 S&P 500 points. Buyers will aggressively scoop that dip and you will have to take action early in the day. If the S&P 500 is down more than 20 points and overseas markets are down considerably (-1%) we have to tread cautiously and wait for the market to find support. Once it does, there should be a nice reversal into the gap. These early drops make it easy to spot relative strength because the ones that institutions are buying will tread water. They will be good for that day and they are likely good bullish swing candidates.

It doesn’t matter that we don’t like Fed tightening or softening global economic conditions or the threat of a regional bank crisis. We trade what is in front of us. The breakout is not ideal because the volume is light. That means we keep our trades short term and we don’t go “gonzo” with our longs. We focus on bullish trades until the market has a nasty long red candle that takes back days of gains.

This is a fairly high odds trading environment and you need to treat it as such.

Today the FOMC statement will be released. Traders are expecting a pause. Know that the action is going to be fairly dull after a few hours of trading. If the reaction is muted or bullish, stick with the instructions provided above. If the reaction is bearish, the breakout could be tested at $430. If it holds, we will have a nice entry point for longs. Only nimble pros should consider shorting. Most of you should be in a mindset that any drop is going to be a buying opportunity as long as SPY $430 holds.

I hope this helps all of you. Trade well.
