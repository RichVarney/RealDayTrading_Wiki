Let's face it, the vast majority of traders across the spectrum prefer to trade rallies. The price action is more consistent and it puts everyone in a great mood. The economy is doing well, portfolio values are up and people have jobs. After a nasty start to the year we would like to think that the worst is behind us. Technically, the market looks great and we have been nailing bullish trades left and right. This is like the first warm day in Chicago after a cold winter and it feels really good.

Some of you will be tempted to start taking overnight longs aggressively. It is still too early and I suggest you stick with very short term trades and wait for confirmation (follow through). Here's why.

On a day trading basis, we don't have to worry about fundamentals. We trade what is in front of us and we keep our overnight risk at a minimum. When you lengthen your trade duration, fundamentals do become more important. There will be some of you who are tempted to "back up the truck" and load up on bullish overnight positions based on what you see right now. I wrote this post to shed light and hopefully to keep you from making a devastating mistake.

**Has the Fed stopped raising rates?** No. In fact, they are going to raise rates next week. Some projections are as high as 100 basis points (75 likely). Yesterday the ECB hiked rates by 50 basis points and that was more than expected.

**Have we felt the impact of the rate hikes to this point?** No. We will not know the impact of higher interest rates for a few months. The economic data points will be very important in Aug/Sept.

**Has inflation subsided?** No. There are some signs (mainly energy) that we might have climaxed, but that is a far cry from seeing a decline in prices. We just came off of the highest readings in 40 years. For the last year we've heard that inflation is temporary and it continues to surprise the Fed.

**Is China strong?** No. The second largest economy in the world and the global growth engine the last two decades is "on the ropes". They are still in shutdown mode because of Covid-19 and we can expect more supply disruptions. Property developers are defaulting, people are not able to access deposits at rural banks, home owners are not paying mortgages on new construction at the risk of ruining "social credit" and funds have been selling Chinese bonds for a record 5th month in a row. After decades of hyper growth, China is my biggest market concern long term. I smell a rat and I suspect credit issues will surface.

The list is long and I could continue, but I won't. These issues need to be resolved and it will take time. It is typical for the market to rally into earnings season. Big tech companies will announce earnings next week and after that, "the air will be let out of the balloon". The Fed will hike rates and they will vanish until September when another rate hike is expected. The rat population will decline in DC as politicians take recess. The country will be on "auto pilot" and the issues I have outlined will fester without anyone at the helm. Trading volume will dry up and we will be in a news vacuum for weeks.

So I must be bearish - right? I do believe that the market will test the low of the year. Depending on how things play out, we might even take it out. I am not positioning myself for a big drop, but I am very ready to trade it if the price action deteriorates. I am certainly NOT loading up on longer term bullish positions and that is what I want to discourage you from doing. This is how accounts "blow up".

The strong technicals we are currently seeing were also present in March. Look at how similar the chart below is to the first chart I posted. All of the same technical breakouts were present (I copied and pasted the blue box). From that peak to the next low the SPY dropped more than 15%. Longer term swing traders who bought on those strong technicals took a beating and they fueled the market drop when they bailed on their positions.

The recent market rally came on low volume, just like the bounce in March. These moves look great on the surface, but buyers have a low level of conviction and this bounce can easily be reversed.

DON'T LOAD UP ON LONGER TERM BULLISH SWING TRADES.

To complete my metaphor, it is only March in Chicago and we can still expect cold weather. I hope this posts helps you avoid a costly mistake. Stay short term with your trades. The time for longer term bullish swings will come, be patient. These issues need to be resolved and we do not know the outcome. When we see stacked green candles consecutively on heavy volume, we can start taking longer term bullish trades.
