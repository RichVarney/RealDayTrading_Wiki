Since I posted about the identification of a method to find the highest probability trades I have gotten a number of questions that can be summed up as; "What happened to Relative Strength/Relative Weakness? Are we no longer using that??"

So let's clarify a few things - 

**1)** You currently set alerts on your charts (or you should be) based on Technically derived prices.  For example, you might set an alert on **UPST** at $114.29, as that is where the SMA50 sits on the daily chart.  This is a smart alert as you would want to know when that stock breaches the moving average resistance level.  Does setting this alert negate the usage of RS/RW in doing analysis on the stock?  Does it negate doing analysis on the market conditions before making any trade?  No - it simply alerts you to a fact - **UPST** broke through a commonly agreed upon level of resistance.

**2)** We all know that breaks of support/resistance are effective but *not 100% effective* at predicting directional continuation.  In other words, we have all seen a stock break through its' SMA, even confirm that breach the following day, only to fall/rise back to its' previous levels.  **UPST** for example, broke through the SMA50 on 3/17, hovered above it for five days and then promptly dropped back down again.  Thus, the goal is to find alerts that give the *highest probability* of directional continuation.  

**3)** Stocks can break through traditional levels of S/R (horizontal trend lines, technical patterns, moving averages) but not have Relative Strength or Weakness.  The market may be exceptionally strong or weak on that day and simply bring the ticker with it.  Therefore you may get an alert but that doesn't mean it would be a good trade.   Thus, what would make an alert have a *high probability* of success would be if it *also* ticked off all the checkboxes at the same time.  If by virtue of breaking a price point it inherently meant the stock also needed RS/RW that would certainly increase the edge one gets in their trade.  That would require price points that offer Support or Resistance with sufficient strength that it takes more than just a market move to breach them.  It would require strength/weakness in the stock *independent* of the market.

That brings us to the Algo price points.  Understand that you will not find Algo price points on any search - the best you will come up with is *trendlines*.  

***And while Algo Lines are technically Trendlines, not all Trendlines are Algo Lines***

The reason you will not find anything is that the discovery of Algo lines comes from Institutional practices that they do not advertise, and with good reason.  Institutions make a great deal of money off retail investors by knowing exactly where they intend to *buy*/*sell* based on traditional technical analysis.  They are so familiar with *Retail* behavior that they are able to trap them quite easily (as some of you are intimately familiar). 

Every retail trader should be striving towards the goal of trying to understand *exactly where Institutions will buy or sell a stock*.  

**Algo lines** give one a strong insight into where those levels are, and once you learn to draw them you can see firsthand how well they work in predicting points stocks cannot seem to get through.  

**Algo Price Points** goes one level deeper and gives retail traders the precision needed to place effective alerts.

The triggering of those alerts then provide extremely high probability set-ups, which is the ultimate goal.  And the amount of capital deployment/removal required to trigger an alert of such high standards would indicate RS/RW by default.  Does this mean you still do not look to see confirm the RS/RW, of course not, but a much higher percent of alert based off these price-points will qualify.

Hope this makes things easier to understand.

 

Best,
