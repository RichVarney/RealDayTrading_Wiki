EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

Anyone that came to this sub not knowing a thing about Day Trading would walk away thinking that the following is the primary activity:

*Stock is going up fast - lots of volume - buy stock, try to sell it before it goes back down.*

*Sure, there are some indicators that people like to use and maybe some basic candlestick patterns, but as long as I have a few basic rules on some post-its stuck to my monitor, I am going to be rich!*

Here's what happened - at some point when Day Trading started to become popular a natural business opportunity arose - people realized they could make money off the influx of new people.

However the problem was that videos and courses on what Day Trading *really* is would long, arduous and well, not really marketable. So instead they went straight for the most sellable aspect of Day Trading - momentum trading. In reality, this type of trade represents a very small percentage of any successful Day Traders' daily activity; however, that does not matter because - *it is easy to make it look easy*.

These videos come up with easily digestible terms like, "Three Bar Rule" or "Gap n' Go" - but it is all the same thing - and very easy to show visually.

And you see what happened. Hell, any post here that is longer than a 2-minute read and people are clamoring for a TLDR to summarize for them because they have things to do, and reading clearly isn't one of them.

Everything about this marketing push centers around the theme of *Get Rich Quick.* Eventually, that is what most new traders came to believe Day Trading was all about - finding low float cheap stocks with a catalyst and cashing in with a high number of shares on a quick bullish move.

**Example - This is what most think Day Traders do** ***all*** **of the time:**

I went long on PROG right at the open at $3.74, watched it drop all the way down to 3.47 and still held the stock (simply because I liked the Daily stock and worst case scenario I would hold it over the weekend). Wound up selling PROG at 12:25pm (est) at $3.90 for a gain of 16 cents a share. It was a trade based on FOMO and a potential hold where I convinced myself that it would continue its run next week.

Was PROG a bad trade? Well, yes - I shouldn't have bought it on the open. If I were to trade PROG the right way, the best time would have been around 11:15am (est) where I could have gotten it about 10 cents cheaper.

Many others traded NOK at the 10:10am (est) pullback or EXPR for decent gains based on strong relative volume on low float stocks.

*These are all high risk trades that even the most experienced traders get into trouble doing continuously.*

**Example - This is what a majority of Day Traders actually do:**

*I did 17 trades on Friday (several on SPCE alone), but the following are four examples of the types of Day Trades I executed:*

On Friday at the open I did a Call Debit Spread on BABA for 220/225 for a debit of $1.45, at the end of the day I received a credit of $4.50, a profit of $2.05 per contract. BABA was through all major SMA's on the Daily, showed early Relative Strength, and had a positive cross on the TSI.

Or between 10:25am(est) and 10:45am (est) I noticed while SPY declined, JKS climbed. At 10:55 as SPY began to reverse I went long JKS at 41.80 and sold it 20 minutes later for a $1 profit. JKS broke through the 50 SMA and had room before the 100 SMA on the daily, with Relative Strength and Relative Volume over 1.5.

Later that day at 3pm with SPY increasing TSLA began to drop - at around 3:05 with TSLA at 674.56, I short the stock using Lotto Puts. I sold those Puts 15 minutes later for a 250%+ profit. The SMA 100 gave me a good mental stop if a 5 minute candle could close above it.

At 3:15pm (est) SPY started to decline again, this time with a bearish hammer on the M5 - and at the same time the stock MA continued to climb upwards. At 3:35pm (est) I went long at 377.42 on MA, given its continued strength against the market. I sold 25 minutes later at 379.25 at 3.56pm as I did not want to hold the stock overnight. Total profit - $1.83 per share. MA broke above the 8EMA around 1pm (est) and held the line all the way up from there.

*It is not the momentum trading isn't legitimate or profitable, it can be - it is just a small part of Day Trading and requires a lot more expertise than is advertised.*

Unfortunately by the time most people realize that momentum trading is *not easy* and that their early gains were more due to luck than anything else - they have already blown up their accounts. At this most point most walk away thinking that Day Trading is gambling, mainly luck and that Technical Analysis is Voo-Doo. I suspect if I believed that Day Trading was primarily "Gap n' Go" strategies, I might think that as well.

My recommendation to new traders is always the same - In the beginning:

*Don't scalp.*

*Don't Trade Morning Gappers or Momentum Stocks.*

*Stick to small positions and make solid Day Trades with a repeatable strategy.*

***Day Trading is a complex field that takes years to learn and master.***

***Anything or anyone that tells you otherwise is either a scam or has fallen prey to a marketing strategy.***

***As I preach in most of my posts, Day Trading for a living is a very rewarding life and achievable - but it takes a lot of time (roughly two years) and effort before you can become consistently profitable.***

*As usual if you comment just to be purely antagonistic or cynical, bash Day Trading in general, or if you attack me personally, I will not respond.*
