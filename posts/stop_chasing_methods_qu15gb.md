Many of you just can't stop looking for new "foolproof" methods.   I get it, I was that way too when I started.

In this sub you have watched as I turned a $30K account into $60K in five weeks time, I did it publicly, posting every trade live and sharing the trading journal with everyone.  You are currently watching u/Professor1970 turn $5K into $30K, also in real time.

Every single thing you need, to learn how we, and the other pros, do this everyday is here in the Wiki.  All the resources you need to is also listed here.  

Am I saying this is the *only* way to do it? No, of course not.  But I can tell you this - the professionals that run this sub have tried just about everything you can think of, and I can assure you that if you are either a new trader, or a trader that can't seem to "get it right" - this is absolutely the best way.  I've literally spent several hours these past few days looking up various "systems" that people have posted, just to see if they are *ok* to be posted here.   You want to talk about a method being used, then write a post and *describe* the method, you don't need to shill a service to do that.  If you are truly trying to help other traders than put the method out there and let's discuss it.  

But the truth is, and I will reiterate this over and over - *there is no quick method to doing this, no shortcuts.*  Even the method here will take you a long time and a lot of effort to learn and get right.  Do not expect to be successful after just a few months.  Still, everyday I see many of you looking for that shortcut, looking for one more method, one more strategy that if you just followed to the letter would make you profitable.  *It doesn't exist*.  

The more you search, the more you "gurus" you will find - some will swear on volume profiles, others bank on pure pattern trading, but in the end it doesn't matter.  Because they are talking about a specific method for specific conditions for which you still need a lot of experience to pull off correctly.  It isn't even a matter of whether or not what they do works or doesn't work - you are being taught a method here that we *know* works for new and struggling traders.  

What we teach here is a foundation, an overall approach that can give you a lifelong professional with financial independence.  If we felt that one of those other methods were better at helping you become profitable, trust me it would be taught in this sub.  The same goes for the millions of indicators out there - yes, Bollinger Bands are useful, so is the Ichimoku Cloud - but it is not the right indicator for traders that need help.  Pivot levels and Volume Profile analysis is nothing new, you can wrap it up and resell it a million different ways, but it is also the same thing, all trying to find levels of Support and Resistance.

I tend to give *tough love* on here for a reason - *I don't want to see you lose your money*.  And I will tell you this - if you get the mindset part right, then learn the method taught here - and once you are successful at that, *you should absolutely branch out and learn other strategies.*  But if you can't get to the point where you are consistently profitable with what we are teaching here, than I will guarantee you that your shortcut will not work.  Because at that point your issue is one of work ethic.  

Think of it this way - Imagine you are an executive at a successful company, and every month a new crop of interns and assistants come through the door.  And you genuinely want to see all of them succeed.  Some of them learn everything they can, work hard and get promoted, some of them now even work side-by-side with you everyday.  Others, fresh out of college, or even worse - fired from several other companies, come in and immediately start suggesting differently ways of doing things, jumping in during meetings and offering their *ideas*, or something they read somewhere.   After awhile you can get pretty good at seeing who is going to succeed and which ones aren't.

So what you might see as me and others being "defensive" or "not willing to try new things" is actually just us not wanting *you* to lose your money and knowing that is exactly what will happen.  I honestly wish that you will all become successful at this, I do.  And I know that many of you won't, but I am going to do everything I can to lower that number as much as possible.  If that means telling you to stop chasing every shiny object out there, and learn the method taught here - that is what I am going to do.

Best. H.S.
