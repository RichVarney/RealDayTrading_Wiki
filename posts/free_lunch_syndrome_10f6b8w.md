**Are you trying to get a free lunch?**

If you're spinning your gears and feel like you are stuck in your progress as a trader, you might be suffering from "free lunch" syndrome.

step 1 - you make some trades and they lose painfully for whatever reason

step 2 - this upsets/traumatizes you so you change your position strategy to "protect" yourself from that specific way of eating shit

step 3 - this opens up another way to eat shit

step 4 - you eat shit that different way during a repeat of step 1

This is what I call free lunch syndrome and it's a constant hamster wheeling through positioning strategies that ruins the forward progress of a trader

Someone suffering from free lunch syndrome isn't "fixing their trading" they are trying to avoid the emotional pain of learning by unknowingly destroying their long term success.

**What position strategy should you use?**

When trading the market, you're basically making a judgement call about the probability of a direction of a ticker. But it's not that simple.

1 - where do you see your thesis taking you at least and/or at best?

2 - at what point does the probability of your thesis happening drop to the level of exit?

3 - **how long** do you want to allow for this all to unfold?

4 - what is the d1 and market looking like contextually?

This is *way way* more complicated and nuanced that it seems on the surface and being able to get accurate at this takes a massive amount of repetition, experience and practise.

Here's a simple straightforward way to parse it out

**Shares**

**PROS** \- you can enter/exit whenever you like and you can take as long as you want for your thesis to unfold, trade super small to learn and bag hold forever.

**CONS** \- getting your sizing right is ***crucial*** and your downside is infinite in a practical sense.

**Straight Contracts**

**PROS** \- awesome leverage to take more trades with bigger size, and also caps your downside to a max of the intrinsic value of the contract. You can use lots or # contracts for sizing and work with percent gain/loss

**CONS** \- you're on a clock, even the smallest contract is HUGE size for a beginner, and all sorts of theta, IV, and bullshit can make you lose even if you hit your target

**Debit Spreads**

**PROS** \- you cap your downside to the size of the spread so you can take trades that might have less room to profit and more room to lose. The time decay works in your favor and you can scratch or profit even when it doesn't move much

**CONS -** you cripple your profit potential which can ***easily*** put you underwater in the long run if your overall loss rate and loss size is too big. You have to use a weekly expiry so your clock is even shorter.

**Credit Spreads**

**PROS** \- you make money on this thing as long as it doesn't cross a certain price point by expiry

**CONS** \- needs serious market support and a killer d1. If you are wrong you are going to lose up to 4 times what you could win.

&#x200B;

**Time Spreads**

**PROS** \- they work a lot and don't really require any active management

**CONS** \- if you lose, you usually lose the entire debit. At best you can roll the dice on and otm long strike

as you can see NONE of these positioning strategies are bulletproof and ALL of them have a different big downside to them.

In fact, I strongly believe that you will actually *cripple* your chances of success by trying to flip flop around to emotionally protect yourself. All you do is deepen your scars and mess up the ability for you to **feel the right feelings when presented with opportunities in the market**

#### You will not be able to cover up a lack of contextual decision quality by changing your positioning strategy. You will just emotionally scar yourself in new and exciting ways that cripple your ability to make good trades....

#### forever.

I need to stress the forever part. You are messing with the internal mechanics of your emotional feedback system in a way that ruins your ability to have a traders mind. You'll bog yourself down in "trade trauma" and that might mean you run out of money or time before you get through it.

**So what do you do?**

1 - make sure you are sized appropriately for you **emotional**  level of development as a trader, otherwise you are risking scars that never heal.

2 - accept your ass kicking as part of the learning process and learn how to make the best possible decisions from it. you're supposed to suck, trading is really really hard.

3 - positioning strategies will **not** protect you from that ass kicking. If you think it will, you are forfeiting your chances of making it just to feel a little better today.

4 - expect a time frame to success that's not about learning the strategy, it's about *changing your emotional makeup.* This takes way way longer.

I fell in to this trap at the start of last year. I felt like CDS and PDS were magic. and when I finally did lose it was really painful and kicked me back to the stone age emotionally.

Ask yourself, is your goal to feel good today or become a trader who is consistently profitable? Many of us don't want to admit we're in the former camp.
