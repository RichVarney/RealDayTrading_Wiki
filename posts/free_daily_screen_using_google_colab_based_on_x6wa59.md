I'm still a newb (only been paper trading 3 months) and sometimes I feel like I'm scrambling to find good stocks during trading hours. As a result I feel like I'm chasing moves, so I'm trying to be more systematic in my prep work using u/HSeldon2020 's post [Keeping it Really Simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/svn70b/keeping_it_really_simple/?context=3) as the foundation.

[Here's a python notebook](https://pastebin.com/Ui05nTrV) that anybody can download, upload to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and run. As of Friday's close (9/2/22), here are the stocks in the S&P500 that fit Hari's rules 3 and 4:

Longs

- CAH

Shorts

- AMD
- BKNG
- DOW
- DPZ
- EQIX
- FCX
- FIS
- FLT
- HPQ
- HRL
- HSIC
- IQV
- LYB
- MPWR
- NSC
- NVDA
- NWL
- PVH
- RL
- RTX
- SEDG
- SWK
- T
- TTWO
- TWTR
- VZ
- XRAY

Over time I plan on adding more criteria to this workbook based on RSRW vs SPY and sector ETFs, and expanding beyond just the S&P500. Also if I can figure out how to automate technical analysis like on FinViz charts I'll add that too. Let me know what you think!

EDIT: here's the list of stocks as of today's (9/6) close, including if the stock was mentioned in today's chat:

Longs

- CBOE, no

Shorts

- AMD, yes
- BKNG
- DOW, yes (by me)
- DPZ, yes (also by me)
- EQIX
- FCX
- FIS
- FLT
- HPQ, yes
- HRL
- HSIC
- IQV
- LYB
- MPWR
- NSC
- NVDA, yes (Hari closed position)
- NWL
- RL
- RTX, yes
- SWK
- T
- TTWO, yes
- VZ
- XRAY

Pretty much the same on the short side except PVH, SEDG, and TWTR didn't have flat-topped candles today. CBOE has a weird D1 chart because both the last two days were gap up red candles, although it did close above the SMA today.
