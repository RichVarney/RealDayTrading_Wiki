Picking bottoms is a nasty habit when it comes to personal hygiene or trading. When the drop is particularly steep it is a massive warning sign. Sellers are aggressive and they are pounding every bid in sight. Buyers see their orders getting filled and they cancel their bids (buy orders) on the notion that they will be able to enter at a lower price. The rout is on and the red candles start stacking on heavy volume.

Before we get started, familiarize yourself with some of the [terms I will be using](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/10cmbrl/trendline_terms_and_basics/).

As this move unfolds, support levels are obliterated. From a shorting standpoint, that is exactly what we want. We don't want to play "patty cake" at these levels and poke at them, we want to destroy them. Initially, the stock will breach **Low+** trendlines and they will give us an excellent entry point. Notice that the **Low+** had a gradual slope (< 45 degrees). If it was steep, we know not to fade the up trend.

Next, horizontal trendlines fail along with gradual sloping **Low-** trendlines. As you can see in the chart below, each new trendline breach provides confirmation. Eventually, older Low- trendlines will be revealed and they will be triggered all the way down.

These are excellent patterns for shorting. The speed and ferocity of the move (stacked red candles on volume) are the "tells" to watch for early on. The obliteration of support levels is another clue. The **High-** trendlines are close to 90 degrees and that is another sign to watch for. Moves like this tell us that there will be a lot more downside.

As the move unfolds the **Low-** trendline (blue shaded trendline connecting the lows) will also be very steep. As these Low- and **High-** trendlines (blue shaded trendline connecting the highs) converge, a wedge forms. When the angle of the **Low-** is greater than 60 degrees and the angle of the **High-** is greater than 75 degrees, a bounce is likely.  Remember, we do not want to pick bottoms. We need to have some signs of support. In this case you can see that a **High-** trendline with a gradual slope forms. More than a month of trading formed that trendline and you should avoid buying "V" bottom bounces. They can easily fail. That breakout above is tradeable for pros, but you have to use smaller size relative to the shorts you took on the way down, and you do not want to overstay your welcome. It's just a matter of time until "Papa Bear" comes home.

Here's where most traders get into trouble. They start playing fundamental analyst. *"But company XYZ has been around for 20 years and they make the best "gizmo" on the planet. This is a gross over-reaction to the problem and it is a bargain at this level."* Know that the sellers are smarter than you are. They have better information than you do and they have infinitely more money than you do. They are the reason the chart looks like shit. When you see a chart like this the red warning signs should be flashing for many months and your mindset should always be to short breakdowns.

Towards the end of the chart you will see another wedge formation. This one is fairly balanced unlike the descending wedge earlier. The **High-** trendline signals a breakout and bottom pickers rejoice. *"Finally everyone else understands what a great bargain this stock is at this level."* They entertain thoughts of how much money they are going to make when the stock gets back to its high. That little **High-** breakout lured them in and now they are going to get the door slammed in their face - it was a fake. When the stock dropped back below the **High-** trendline the bottom pickers were left with a stinky finger and a loss. Then the **Low+** trendline failed and then a **Low-** trendline failed. This was added confirmation that another great short was underway.

When you see steep declines like this, know that there will be many shorting opportunities along the way. If the initial drop is extreme (close to 90 degrees) there will be a bounce. For most of you, don't trade it. If you do trade it, watch for signs of support and a **High-** breach. Trade smaller size and exit at the first sign that the bounce has stalled. For most of you, keep drawing those **Low+** and horizontal trendlines. Wait for the second shoe to drop. A plunge like this is going to take a long time to resolve and there will be a very long bottoming process.

I hope this post helps you this year.

Trade well.
