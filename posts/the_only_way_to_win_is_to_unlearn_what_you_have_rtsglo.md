It is a new year which is a perfect time to start with a clean mental slate.

One of the most difficult aspects about teaching traders how to be consistently profitable is how much their heads have been filled with absolute garbage.

*Consider the following:* There is no "*house"* when it comes to the market - meaning, the market has no built-in statistical advantage for or against you, the way a casino does.  You are free to choose either side of a trade, and to decide whether to use stocks or options - and for every trade you make, someone else is on the other side.  They aren't making the exact opposite trade the same time you are - they are just happily taking your order knowing you will probably lose.

Think about that - every market maker and institution out there would be more than happy to take the other side of a retail traders position - no matter what that position is - you want to be short **AAPL**, great, they are lined up going long.  Want to go long **AAPL**? Fine - that same money is ready to take the bearish side.

Why?  ***Because they know you will play it wrong.***

Let's look at the Monty Hall Problem for a moment.  For those that don't know it, it is a famous example of how people are bad at statistics:

If a contestant on a game show was told there are three doors - behind one of those doors is a new car but you don't know which door it is, and behind the other two is nothing. All they need to do is pick the right door to win.  In other words, they have a 33% chance of winning.

They pick door number 1 (or 2 or 3, doesn't really matter) - but before the host of the game show opens door number 1, she opens door number 2 showing there is nothing behind it.  She then asks the contestant if they want to switch their original pick of Door 1 to Door 3.

Over 70% of people would stick with their original pick (i.e. roughly 70% of people get this question wrong).  However, Door 3 has a 66.6% chance of having the car behind it, and the original pick only has a 33.3% chance.  In other words, you should only stick with the original door if you don't really want a new car.

Knowing how often contestants would make the wrong choice, I would bet against them getting a car every time.  Why? Because I know I have a 57.1% chance of being right and winning the bet. (e.g. the 70% of idiots will still win 33.3% of the time, and the 30% that know math will win 66.6% of the time, meaning on average 42.9% of contestants would win the car, and 57.1% would leave with nothing) If I bet against the contestant 100 times, I am going to win around 57 of those bets on average.

Is the game fixed against the contestant? No, in fact, in this case, it is actually fixed in their favor.  I just know they are likely to screw it up.

That is like the market - *it is actually fixed somewhat in your favor* \- all the data and indicators are there, an overall bullish trend exists, the *story* of what stock is doing is being played out in front of you, and you have complete freedom to choose any trade you want.  If you can't get the odds better than random chance with all of that going for you than you shouldn't be trading. But much like the contestant, traders do not play correctly and therefore lose.

Part of this is due to bullshit clich√© sayings that everyone tends to believe to be gospel, like:

*Buy Low - Sell High!* So many traders trying to pick bottoms, and what wind ups happening is they - *Buy low, panic and sell lower but then watch it go higher as they start a bad drinking habit.*

Instead it should be *Buy High - Sell Higher*. But people don't like to do that.  *When is the best time to buy a stock (i.e. when it is most likely to go up after you buy it?) -* ***right after it hits its' All-Time-High***.  But this is usually when retail traders try to *short* or *wait for a dip*.  The opposite of what they should be doing.

Or everyone's favorite - *Nobody ever went broke taking a profit* \- um, yeah they did, all the damn time.  Because if the times you a take profit is less frequent, and/or much smaller in size than your losses,  hell yes, you can go broke. Most of the time you should be *adding to your winners* not getting out of the trade.

The truth is, *most trades are winners* (especially bullish trades in a bullish market) it is just a matter of *when.*  If on Monday I bought 1,000 shares of **AAPL** at $177.50, I can be about 99.9% sure that at some point in the next year I am going to be in profit on that trade - lest I think that $177.50 is going to be the highest price **AAPL** will see for the next twelve months.  So it really is just a matter of *when* it will be in profit.

Now, if I pick a volatile stock like **SAVA** and buy a 1,000 shares on Monday at $43.50, there is a somewhat higher chance that the stock will never again go above that price, but even with a stock like that, the chance is very low.  Again, it really is just a matter of *when*.

The other side of the trade is banking on the fact that you will exit before that "*when"* occurs.  Especially if you are using options when you have a ticking clock working against you, and time decay eating away at the value.

For example, on 12/23 I shorted **RBLX** using Put Options, and the price was around $101 at the time, which turned out to be a poor entry on my part.  The next day **RBLX** went to $108.79 - I held (all while getting constant questions of "*Hey Hari - are you still in RBLX?*" (while I felt like saying, "*Yes you fucking taint-stick I am still in the damn trade",* I just ignored the inquires instead).  The following day, **RBLX** peaked around $107 - I held again.  It finally started dropping and I added to the short, the last day of the trade **RBLX** dropped to $95 - I took profit.

How many of you would have bailed when **RBLX** went to $102 that same day? If you held on, how many would have definitely exited when it almost hit $109 two days after taking the trade?  What about on the third day when it showed signs of weakness but still hit close to $107?

You can see the candle after I shorted never really got above the low of the candle before **RBLX** gapped down - that told me that this little bump up was meant to do one thing - flush out shorts like me - well I refused to be flushed damnit!

Through the course of that trade you had a *loser,* a *breakeven* and a *winner* \- the only question is - when do you exit?

A hard stop would have had you exiting at a loss, a mental stop above the low of the candle before the gap up would have had one exiting at even a bigger loss - only by letting that next day's candle play out, and finish at $105, then adding during the drop the next day,  and finally taking profits when it hit support do you come out with a good winner.

Open up trading journal (and if you don't have one then what the hell are you waiting for)?

Go to every losing trade you had that is more than 2-weeks old, and calculate the following:

**1)** What percent of your losing trades *would* have been winners at *some point* after you exited - if you had options than chart that option position, and if it ever exceeded the price you bought it at, after you closed the trade for a loss.

**2)** Of the trades that *would* have been winners, what percent are stock and what percent were options?

**3)** What is the average amount of time you would have had to wait until they turned into winners for stocks? Options?

You will find that a majority of the stock trades *would* have been winners at some point - if you don't see that you are not picking good stocks.  Next you will find that ITM Options would have been winners more than half of the time - again, if not you are picking the wrong stocks.  Finally, you will find that a majority of the OTM Options you lost on would never have been winners no matter how long you waited.

As noted earlier a vast majority of stocks will *eventually* be winners, but since we are short-term traders here, picking the right stocks is *crucial* because you need them to exceed your entry price in a relatively short period of time.

Doing this will tell you if your issue is primarily with the stocks you are picking, or if it lies in when you are exiting (or both).

**Finally,** add up all the times your losing positions *could* have been winners, and then add that total to your winning positions - what is you winning percentage now?  Thus if you made 100 trades and had 40 winners and 60 losers, but among those 60 losers 35 of them *could* have been winners if you played it correctly, you *could* have had 75 winners and 25 losers.  That is a good winning percentage.  Your issue most likely isn't with your picks, but rather how you are playing them. Make sense?

Another thing you are likely to notice is that any *momentum trades* you did had the lowest chance of turning into winners even if you held them - which is why they are so dangerous.  A $5 stock that jumps $7 only to start dropping may not see that $7 level again for a long time.  Whereas a stock like **AAPL** is much more likely to return to your entry price in a short period of time.

Essentially what is happening is you are actually putting the odds in your favor through your analysis - using scanners and indicators you are most likely picking the right stock more than half the time.  If not you are definitely not doing it correctly - your picks should *at least be better than random choice*.

So you are entering into trades with an *edge* \- it is your actions *after* you enter the trade that is turning those trades into losers.  How can that be? How does one take a trade that is statistically in their favor and turn it into a loser?  Because the other side of that trade know exactly *how you think*.  They know when you are likely to jump ship and exactly at what price they need for a majority to finally say, "No more - I am out!".  They know it so well, they can program it - those algorithms are literally designed with your mentality in mind.

And what is that mentality based on?  All the crap you have been taught about trading combined with the average mindset of someone that wasn't born wealthy (i.e. making decisions based on fear of loss).  They use your predictable psychological responses to take away your statistical advantage.

They only way to combat this is to, in the words of a short little green man, *Unlearn what you have Learned*.

**That is what this sub endeavors to do - replace all that crap with tools you need to win.**

Best, H.S.
