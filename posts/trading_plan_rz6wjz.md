Hello everyone,

I have been spending some time reviewing my trading performance for 2021. Being the few months I have been at it more or less full time and recording my trades. Upon inspection I am discovering some real humbling data. I am simply not staying very disciplined in my trading. Yeah I know in my head what I need to be looking for, when I should be taking a trade and when not to. Of course I am seeing some real tangible improvements but also some glaringly obvious faults. So in my effort to correct that, and thanks to nice long night of staring at the ceiling unable to sleep, I decided to make a hard copy trading plan. I've printed it off and have it right in front of me at my desk. I haven't been in the best place mentally for trading lately and maybe this is the fix I needed, maybe it isn't. At the very least I can say writing it out gave me a kick in the head to wake up to all the dumb mistakes I have been making so hopefully I can make less of those going forward.

So, I'm sharing it here and if any of you feel like this is the type of thing you can use, please feel free to copy and make whatever changes that fit you or use it as a rough template to create your own (probably the better idea). If this is something you've already done, well good for you and id like to hear about what you've implemented that made a real difference for you. You will notice I have some numbers in there like my income goal, this will be changing as I progress, And some numbers I'm missing, this is going to be an evolving thing and is just a first draft. If I find I'm offside on some of this in a month I'll rewrite certain things and adjust.

At the end of the day I need to be treating this like a business, a job. If this is to be my career I owe it at least that much effort right. So just like starting a business, you make a business plan so you aren't going in blind. At the very least this will act as a simple game plan condensing a few key points for myself. Let me know what you think!

Regards,

AJ
