I've been using this to quickly find significant lines on d1 charts like algo lines or "zones" of high volume and it's really easy and fast. Essentially it helps me vet how significant lines of support/resistance are.  


It helped me find TDOC today breaking out of 5' compression:

Have it as a tab on your d1 chart and you can switch between regular candles, HA candles, and this view and you can quickly swap views like the Predator vision :)  


The lighter the candle, the higher the volume. The darker the candle, the lower the volume. It pretty much hides low volume stuff entirely so you can "see through the noise"
