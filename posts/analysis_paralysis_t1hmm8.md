I am seeing this so often I think I am going to put in place a new rule for this sub - but first let me explain -

**Analysis Paralysis** is an affliction on both new and struggling traders.  The cure for it is the **Wiki**, but so many suffers of this horrible disease simply do not want to take the remedy.

The first symptoms involves the constant hunt for new *indicators* \- it is almost a guarantee that if you looked at the browsing history of those with this disorder, aside from some really freaky shit, you will also find Google searches like, "Top 5 Best Indicators for Day Trading".   

They'll burn through the major ones pretty quickly...the *Ichimoku Cloud* gets old pretty quick, so do *FIB* levels (especially when you find out they are utterly useless), and before you know it you're looking at *TTM Squeeze's* and *Volume Profiles,* charts filled with pivot points and countless lines.  Although each line will be a different color,  because, yeah, that really helps make sense of it all.

Shockingly they keep losing their money.  Do they go for the cure then? No!  That would just be too easy for our diseased brethren - *they forge forward!*

***Because now they are going to create something brand new!***

Before ever really having a single profitable month, before mastering any strategy (*you know, like the one in the damn Wiki*), they figure that they will come up with a *new method* that nobody has ever thought of before!

***I mean who better to discover the Holy Grail of Trading then a someone who hasn't yet managed to actually withdraw profit from their account?***  

So they combine, and combine, and then combine some more....and then comes the signals!  When this crosses that, and this goes above that, right as it enters this range right here, BAM - Buy Signal!

It is constant, almost non-stop, one trader after another, and they post these new methods, and then you never hear from them again.  Care to guess why?

Let's just make this clear - *this place is a training program.*  You don't come into a training program, completely untrained yourself, and then start telling the other people there that you have a better way to train.  

So unless you have mastered this method, or have proven that you have mastered another method in a consistently profitable way.....*nobody wants to see the symptoms of your illness, which by the way is contagious!*

Best,

H.S.
