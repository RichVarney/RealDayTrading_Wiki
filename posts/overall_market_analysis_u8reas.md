If you go back four months exactly (1/21) you will see that SPY is in the same position as it is today.  It may not seem like it, given the roller-coaster feel day-to-day, but when you zoom out a bit, it is clear - we haven't moved. So what does that mean? The answer is equal parts psychological as it is financial.

Clearly it tells you that the market is in a holding pattern, that much is obvious. Given that the natural tendency of all markets is to go up, holding patterns reflect uncertainty. But uncertainty is bearish, right? Yes, it is - but in degrees. There is uncertainty, but not *enough* to cause a rise in fearful trading.  Due to being in an unprecedented decade-plus long Bull Market, a *lot* of capital is invested into equities. So much money has poured into the market since 2009 that it is baked into the very fabric of Institutional business plans. Trillions of dollars do not suddenly up and leave without good reason, meaning it needs a significant event (i.e. Credit crisis) to cause a fundamental shift in mindset. Consider that we had a *pandemic, historical-levels of inflation, meteoric rise in the deficit (which is only now being lowered), and some of the tensest international conditions since WWII,* and none of those qualified as a *significant event*.    


In essence the market is waiting for a sign to be comfortable again, whether that is lowering inflation, easing of those international tensions, anything, before resuming its climb upwards. However, it is also not straying too far from the lower end of the range, as while a *significant event* has not occurred, the market is clearly not discounting the possibility that it *could*.   
Imagine that on any given day there is a "Chance the World will go to Shit" meter on the wall of every major investment firm. Further imagine that on average that meter says 1% - meaning there is a 1% chance that at some point that year, the world will indeed - go to shit. 1% is low enough for the Risk profile to remain bullish. Now let's say that if that number hits 10% that would be far too high for anyone's taste resulting in a mass exodus from equity positions. What the market is telling us right now is that somewhat fictional meter stands at around 5% - right in the middle. Not high enough to bail, but not low enough to start buying.  


This causes macro-level Chop in SPY, which may have directional periods of time where it seems like it is rebounding for a few days or dropping, but it is still chop.  It also means that unless we see a strong stimulus in either direction, we will remain in that chop.  This provides an excellent environment for Day Trading (and I am taking full advantage), but a very challenging one for short-term positions.
