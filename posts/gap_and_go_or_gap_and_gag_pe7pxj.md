In my previous posts I have mentioned the importance of market analysis and context. How does the current market move fit into the longer term picture? Knowing this puzzle piece will help you plan your trading day before the open. 

Let’s say that the S&P 500 is up 30 points before the open. Everything is flying and it looks like the action is going to be hot. The problem with buying an opening gap higher is that we do not know if profit taking will lead to a gap reversal or if buyers are so aggressive that the opening price will also be the low of the day.  

Currently the market momentum is very strong and the pattern on a daily chart can be described as a gradual drift higher with brief dips and snap back rallies that lead to a new high. After these drops and bounces the market falls back into the drift higher. The candles compress and there are many doji formations (closing price is equal to the opening price). 

If the market has dropped to the 50-day MA and it has found support the next day we often see an overnight gap up. Many of those have resulted in “Gap and Go” days. Buyers are aggressive now that support has been confirmed and they are anxious to join the longer term market uptrend. You can be more aggressive with your buys in this scenario. In the chart you can see how even on these days most of these candles still have a tail under body so there is a chance to get in better than the opening.

If the market is gapping up to a new all-time high you have to be careful. That move will excite bullish speculators and they will load up on the open. In the first 30 minutes we often see profit taking and those buyers are trapped (“Gap and Gag”). They are going to choke on their longs and they will accelerate the reversal as they bail on their trades. Also know that if the market had a “Gap and Go” to a new all-time high the previous day, know that a second “Gap and Go” is less likely.

If the market gaps up and it is in the middle of the 20-day range, look at previous candles. Chances are you will see candlesticks that have tails under the body. That tells you that you are likely to see a price during the day that is lower than the opening price and you will have a chance to buy. You do not have to chase. 

It is always best to error on the side of caution when you are trading in the first 30-45 minutes of the day (even if there is no gap). You don’t know what the market is going to do. When you have a gap up you also have a lot of “fakes”. All ships rise with the tide and some of these stocks will reverse easily. After 30-45 minutes you can identify stocks with relative strength and you have a much better sense for market direction/momentum. 

Trade well.
