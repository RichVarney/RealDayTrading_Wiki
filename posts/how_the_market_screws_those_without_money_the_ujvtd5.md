To begin with, let's be upfront about something - there are some very legalistic inequities built into the market.  

Some of them, everyone knows about - the restrictions of PDT or the restrictions of a cash-settled account.  

Others are known, but not widely so - like the advantages of having "Trader Status" from the IRS in the U.S.   

While others still, are not known at all - for example, those that have a high value account (think more than $2 million) *and* have an associated trade-desk with a major firm like Goldman Sachs or JPM, *and* usually have a Bloomberg Terminal to go with it - are able to trade their Options afterhours.  Just imagine the benefit that would be on an earnings release to not have to wait until the opening of the next day!  

All up and down the continuum of trading there are built-in institutional disadvantages to those that have small balance accounts.  These are obviously unfair, but in reality, they are no different than the benefits we see everyday for those with wealth - from Tax Rates and Loopholes, to the ability to hire the best lawyers and accountants. 

***But there is another disadvantage to those trading with small balances - and it comes in the form of Options***.

Some who have watched me trade might notice I have a very particular process:

During market volatility I use Stocks, not Options for a very clear reason, which will be outlined.

1) To begin with, I enter a trade based on the technical environment with both the market and the stock, so let's say I buy 1,000 shares of AAPL today at $158.  

2) But the market reverses and AAPL drops - but I still major technical support for AAPL at $154, so I hold the shares.

3) Next week, next month, whenever - AAPL eventual gets to $160, and I take $2,000 in profit

Why? Because I can.  I can hold those shares without a second thought, without much of a dent in my buying power - they can just sit there and weather the storm.  There is no ticking clock against that position.  What are the odds that AAPL gets over $158 at some point in the future? Almost 100%  What are the odds it gets over $158 in the next week? Far lower.  

Hell, I can handle 100 point drops in my S&P futures position if my overall thesis remains intact - particularly if that position is Bullish.  It is not like the market isn't going to eventually get back to 4176.

So now let's take the same example, but use a trader with only a few thousand as their balance. 

They also note AAPL as a solid pick, and want to go long, but in order to make it a proportionally even percentage of their account as the trade above they would have to only take around 5 shares (because don't forget, I would also have 4X buying power).  Well, unless you in the training phase of only taking 1 share or 1 contract, there is not much upside to 5 shares, is there?  AAPL can go up $5, which is huge and you would make $25. Yay. 

What do they do? Most likely that trader buys a Call Option for next week for $7.80 - at least there they can make some actual money, right?

But as AAPL drops, so does their Call and now it is sitting at $5.30, losing roughly 33% of its' value and time decay it draining it further by the minute.  

They can't lean on that ALGO support at $154, because if AAPL gets anywhere close to that their Option would be worthless - so they close the position and lose $2.50 ($250).  That loss might be 5-10% of their total account.  

Whereas I am still holding the stock, and eventually *will* take the $2 (i.e. $2,000) in profit.  

See the problem?  When you aren't in a straight Bull or Bear market, meaning it is volatile and you can expect many of your positions to go through some turbulence - *Options can crush you very quickly*.  The truth is, the best way to trade a volatile market is to use the Stocks themselves, but stocks are cost prohibitive for a small balance.

Ironically (or intentionally), the one instrument that looks like it is designed to help those without much money actually get some leverage, is also the one instrument that is designed to drain those very accounts.

That is why is it so important to use *every edge* you have when you trade without much money.  As I have pointed out many times - The entire system is set-up against you - and not in a "conspiratorial" way, but rather in very basic, and very transparent, rules and restrictions that aren't designed to help you kind of way.   Even the mindset needed to succeed as a trader is almost polar opposite to the one you use every day.

So every gamble or "gut-based" move you take, each bottom or top you try to predict, every chart you misread - just tilts those odds further against you.  

An analogy here would be that of *counting cards* at *Blackjack*.  A really good card-counter, in the right conditions, can swing the odds in their favor by about 2%.  That is a 52-48 narrow advantage.  But *they have to be perfect*.  The table they choose has to have the right rules (i.e. split Aces more than twice!), the number of decks should be below 8, etc.  They also need to play absolutely perfect strategy with equally perfect betting, on top of getting the count correct every time.

But even the best *card-counter* will lose if they try to veer from what works - that one time they decide they want to stay on that 16 against a dealer's 10 showing with the count in the negative because they have a *gut feeling* that they will bust, that mistake alone can be enough to tilt the odds back to the casino. 

*Do not give the market an inch of an advantage - use every edge you have (i.e. the methods taught here) and don't throw those precious percentage points away.*

Best, H.S.
