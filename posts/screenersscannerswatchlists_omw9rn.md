I see a lot of questions about these so I figured I would try to answer them in one post for everyone.

The first thing to understand is that as Day Traders your list of potential stocks change constantly throughout the day.  The list of stocks that present good opportunities at the opening bell most likely is no longer viable in the afternoon.  That is because one of the great things about being a Day Trader is that profitable set-ups appear through-out the entire trading day.

With that said there are three different kinds of "lists" that you can (and should) be using:

**Watchlist**: This is a static list created by *you*.  Ideally you update this every evening (or pre-market) and it contains stocks that you have had your eye on for very specific reasons.  They may have met your conditions for a potential trade (i.e. several days in a row of bullish price action and high volume), or perhaps you read a post on a ticker that sounded convincing.  Sometimes these are just stocks you like to trade and are familiar with, thus having a comfort level with their charts.  Either way, it helps to categorize these lists, label them and set alert levels on their charts for entry points.  *I can not emphasize enough the importance of setting alerts on your charts.*

**Scanners:** These are constantly running and updating for you, you can set them to run based on any time period you want. I typically have mine to set to scan over the past hour, whereas others update every 5 seconds constantly looking for volume burst.

Scanners should be your go to resource for opportunities.

**Screeners:** Screeners are custom searches that run at your request.  They aren't constantly searching like a **scanner** but are still important to your Day Trading routine.  Traders use this to adjust to the changing market conditions on the fly and require different filters than you might normally be seeing with your **scanners**.

The next natural question becomes: What should the setting be on **Scanners** and **Screeners**?

The answer is - it depends on the trader.

If you want **scanners** that are picking up good *momentum trades,* you want to look for stocks that are typically have:

\- *Volume Increase:* You can set this to be a percent change in volume in the most recent 5-minute bar compared to the average volume of the last 2,3,5,30, etc. days.  Or you can just look for a *Relative Volume* over 1.5 (meaning 150% increase).  There are various settings to use here.

\- *Stock Attributes:* This is a very subjective area, but most traders will look for stocks that are under $10 a share, have a small float (under 50 million or less), and a high short (10% or more).

\- *Price Action:* A volume burst alone is not enough to jump in so you might want to look for the stock to have reached a new high over the past week, month, year, etc.  Certainly over the previous days high.

Those three can act as your foundation for a momentum scanner and then you can build anything you want on it to filter further down (e.g. patterns, trends, indicators)

For stocks that have good Relative Strength, which is what I use primarily:

\- *Relative Strength* \- Obviously.  But this filter is very hard to find.  ThinkorSwim has a RelativeStrength indicator, but it relies more on correlation than proportional strength (e.g. It is fine to identify stocks going up when **SPY** is going down, but if **SPY** is flat and the stock is going up, it won't find it).  TC2000 and OptionStalker both have good RelativeStrength scanners.  Essentially you want something that will look at the percent change in Stock A and compare it to the percent change in **SPY** over the same time period - however, that change has to be proportional to the stock's price and its average true range as well.  *Volume* should be included in this attribute so you don't get stocks that made a big move off very little volume showing up.

You can set scanners to constantly look for anything that fits your trading pattern.  I also like to look for  *Recent Runs -* Stocks that have recently gone on a run, stacking green bars with volume.  These aren't necessarily momentum stocks, but rather stocks that are having a very bullish trend at the moment.

**Screeners** allow for a lot of creativity when looking for stocks.  They are great to use after-hours to find stocks for your *watchlists*, but also really good when the market is open.  Let's say **SPY** has been compressing for the past two hours, so I might look for a stock that has:

\- *Relative Volume on the Daily Chart over 1.5*

\- *Price above previous day High*

\- *Relative Strength to SPY on the Daily Chart*

\- *Currently in a Compression on the 2hr Chart*

Once I get that list, I can then go through the chart and place alert lines on top of the compressions so I will be notified when those stock break to the upside (which they most likely will when *SPY* breaks upwards).

This is one of the reason Day Traders use more than one monitor, as these watchlists, scanners and screeners can take up an entire monitor themselves.

Each platform offers different methods to scan and search - ThinkorSwim has a decent scanner in terms of the inputs, but I constantly find the results to be unreliable.  TC2000 has comprehensive features including the ability to create sequence scans (i.e. first the stock falls below VWAP, then it breaks through VWAP and creates a new high of day, then it falls below VWAP again).  OptionStalker has the best scanners and screeners in my opinion because the entire platform was built around the premise of Relative Strength.

Hope this answers some of the questions!
