There are some methods that we know work - they are tested, used and evidenced through the repeatable consistent profit they produce.  *Those methods are detailed out in the Wiki.*

However there are also some areas of trading that are not nearly as solidified (and others that remain unsolved).  

For example - Being successful under PDT rules is one of those areas.  Swing trading in a choppy market is another (this overlaps with PDT).  Various strategies on trading earnings are successful (we know time spreads work), but other strategies are less consistent. The leverage of using Options vs. the flexibility of time you get with stocks when in a non-directional market.  *These are all relatively unanswered questions.*

In other words, while there is a lot we do know, there is also a large area of inconsistent danger.  In particular those grey areas are concentrated in situations that impact those without much money in their accounts.   I assume it comes as no surprise that the rich gets richer, does it?  Despite the toll the $5K Challenge has taken on my regular trading account it remains very profitable.  Which means simply due to the virtue of that account having money in it, I am able to make money.

As most of you know (although clearly some do not), the nature of experimentation is to try various methods, new methods, combinations of methods and over time rule out what doesn't work.

Normally one would use a paper trading account to do this - but that can only go so far as any result obtained through paper trading would understandably be in question.  There is a clear psychological difference between paper trading and real money.  That difference can mitigate any findings.  If I did the $5K Challenge in a paper account any results I got would be in question - as they should be.   
Thankfully I can afford to experiment with real money and the benefit of that will be the veracity of the findings. 

The goal in experimenting is to not only find what *does work* but to *rule out* what doesn't - only through doing both sides of the equation will you be able to truly nail down a useable strategy.

For example - *Spec Plays.*  I have continued to devote a small percentage of the $5K account to *Spec Plays* (roughly 5%). Currently it seems that overall this strategy is profitable.  What that tells me is to now focus on coming up with the best scans and criteria for those Spec Plays.  This is a finding one would not achieve *without experimentation.* 

I have also found that the *balancing* that works with non-PDT account, does not work well with ones under-PDT rules.   Because balancing gives you small edge (again, think of the 1.5% edge a casino has), anything that reduces that edge can make this method a poor choice.  The lack of flexibility in a PDT account reduces that edge just enough to make *balancing* an undesirable method for small account. However, straight *hedges* still seem to have benefit.  How much? Undetermined.

*Algos Price Points*, which is an expansion on u/onewyse's ALGO line method, clearly seems to work - however, it continues to be a work-in-progress and needs refinement with a number of open questions remaining. Still it remains one of the more promising findings of this process.

*Position Sizing and Risk Management* \- despite what one might think, this remains up-in-the-air.  I am still not convinced that one does not need a Sortino ratio that is strong enough to lift small account to the levels they need to be - however, there clearly does need to be a balance.  Finding that balance is the trick and it is only through experimentation that one can find it. 

For those of you that are constantly saying, "Why are you making that trade????" or "That's not in the Wiki!" you clearly do not get the meaning of the word - "Experiment".  

Another common question/complaint is:

*"Yes, but if all of that is the case then why are making the same mistakes over and over in the $5K account?"*

The answer is - Sample Size.  Before I rule something out I need to be *sure* it doesn't work.

You will also notice I took risks in this account, such as some OTM Options, and the beforementioned Spec plays.  Those risks are heavily discouraged in this sub - so why am I taking them?

Because I also need to know - how much of the method in increasing a PDT-restricted account is rooted in low-probability/high-reward plays and how much of it needs to be based in high-probability/low-reward trades.  I know there is a balance there, what I don't know is *what that balance might be?*

Another question is:

*"Why not just play SPY futures?"*

The answer to that is the same as before - because you need to have a high level of experience to successfully trade SPY futures consistently and I am trying to come up with a method that works for new and struggling traders.  Simple as that.

I took 30 pts off S&P futures on Friday from the $5K account and regret it.  Yes, SPY was ripe for those trades, but again, it is not the answer I am looking to find.

Hopefully when this is done not only will you have a successful method for PDT, but also learn how to *experiment* with trading.

However, despite the knowledge some will gain from learning how to experiment, I am quickly finding that my main regret is in doing any experiment publicly and my mistake was assuming everyone would understand what that meant.  It is not something I will do again.  The self-righteous minority that revels in "Ha! Gotcha!!" type posts and comments are simply too distracting.  In the future all experiments and attempts to find new methods will be done privately, and only when I am finished will I release the results and then trade the strategy in real-time.

Thankfully there does seem to be some that "get it" and are getting value out of watching an iterative process in real-time.  So I hope you soak it up as much as possible while I am doing this one, as I committed to continuing it publicly.  In a sense you are witnessing someone learn a new method as-it-happens, except the method I am trying to learn does not yet exist.  

As for the critique that well....one cannot "critique" what I am doing. Or the always fun, "There is a cult-like mentality".  The answer is of course you can criticize - but do it in the context of what I am doing and in the service of furthering knowledge.  What seems "cult-like" to you is just a community that has higher standards than you are clearly used to seeing. 

For example - If someone has asked: "Why buy back the short side of TSLA when you did? At that point if it turned around the CDS itself would be in a position to be profitable, and if it did not turn around you could have bought it back for much cheaper than you did.  If you are experimenting with buying back the short side on a CDS, it would seem the better experiment in that scenario is - waiting."  **That is a valid critique.**  However, incorrectly saying I bought a bunch of OTM calls on TSLA, when I actually only spent less than $450 on those calls to change the R|R profile is **not a valid critique**.  What bothers me about that particular criticism is that is shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the entire process. 

The purpose of this sub is to *convey knowledge* \- some of the knowledge is proven and invaluable.  Some of it is being created in real-time.  Unfortunately the latter part of that discovery appears to be causing confusion.  If that confusion is due to a lack of clarity on my part, then I apologize. 

Best, H.S.
