Hi everyone,

I've added a bunch of new features to ZenBot Scanner ([www.ZenScans.com](https://www.ZenScans.com)), and my one-man quest to build the ultimate free RSRW stock scanner continues.

Since I launched it six weeks ago ([launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/zaast0/a_new_stock_screener_based_on_relative_strength/)), more than 1500 traders have used it. You people are blowing my mind with all the love, support, testing, and wicked awesome ideas. THANK YOU! I have a lot of love and respect for the tools in our community, and now I know firsthand how much sweat, tears, and care goes into them.

The scanner has some new features that I think you'll like:

* Lots of new built-in long and short scans ([Strong Trend](https://www.zenscans.com/Strong%20ADX%20Trend%20-%20Long), [Trend Signal](https://www.zenscans.com/Trend%20Signal%20-%20Long), 8/20 EMA Cross, Day Breakout, [In The Gap](https://www.zenscans.com/In%20Gap), with more every week)
* Now monitoring 6,000+ tickers including low-float and momentum stocks
* View sectors with relative strength/weakness and view the most tradeable tickers
* Build custom scans using 50+ criteria
* Scan results show multi-timeframe volume and RS/RW
* Scan and filter by all the things you care about
   * Price, sector, relative volume, multi-timeframe rsrw, Laguerre RSI, ADX, BBand width, ema crosses, vwap slope, lots more, sector
   * Chart patterns - consolidation, new highs, day range, compression break, flags, ...
   * Daily chart: above/below SMA, new highs/lows, D1 compression breaks
* Copy scan results to clipboard (great for pasting into ToS, TC2000, etc)
* Launch charts in your chart app (ToS, TradingView, TC2000, and more) with the [ZenBot Scanner Windows app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/zenbot-stock-scanner/9NJXBCJKNBD5?hl=en-us&gl=us)

And lots more coming soon!

* Share your custom scan and filter settings
* Tweak built-in scans and use them as templates
* Alerts

Have fun and let me know what else would help!
