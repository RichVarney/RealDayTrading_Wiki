We have talked a lot in this sub about various mindset issues (all of which can be found in the Wiki) but there is one that we haven't yet touched upon - *the downward spiral.*

Most mental issues are subtle - impacting our decisions on holding a losing trade or taking profits too early.  In general though, one is still able to follow the methods/strategies they learned, apply the solutions outlined in the Wiki and hopefully stay relatively on track as they work through these mindset obstacles.

However, there comes a time in every trader's journey when they simply go on ***tilt***.  We've all been there.  There are three stages to these Meltdown's - 

**Stage 1 - The Trigger** \- This is what sets you off on to your journey towards hell

**Stage 2 - The Insanity -** You are now burning your money

**Stage 3 - The Aftermath -** Some are able to rebound, some are not

Let's start with **Stage 1: The Trigger**

**There are two potential triggers for this, and the first one is obvious -** 

***A Big Loss -*** As much as we try to avoid it, eventually there will come a trade that just kicks your ass.  Your reasoning for entering the trade may have been sound, but somewhere along the way in that trade, you screwed up.  A lot of traders report that they simply *freeze*. Sitting there watching the trade get worse and worse, knowing you should get out but you don't. Eventually the damage becomes so steep that you grit your teeth and exit.  Now you are sitting there looking at this huge hole in your account - any profits from the past week/month are gone and you're stunned.  

Questions begin to run through your head - *Why did I stay in?  Why did I average down? Why am I an idiot?*  

Eventually those questions are replaced with declarations that sound like this - *I will get it back, all of it.  All I need is one good trade, and I am right back to where I was.  I am not going to let this market beat me!*

And that is where the real trouble begins, because this is where you start to go into that downward spiral, making things much, much, worse.

**The other trigger for a meltdown is -** 

***A Big Win -*** Sounds strange right?  Why would someone lose their shit after doing really well?  Good question - and the best answer I can give is...*overconfidence.*  You start to see the extra money you just made as money you can *play with*.  This typically manifests in the form of *scalp* with a big position size.  Not surprisingly your *Big Win* is soon followed up with an even *Bigger Loss*. 

Either way, once you hit that downward skid, things deteriorate pretty fast.   Rules and methods go out the window and the over-trading begins. 

**Now we go on to Stage 2: The Meltdown**

*The following may be familiar:*

*Go Long on Stock X for $4.60, big position....shit it dropped to $4.45, ok I am out....besides I should be shorting Stock Y at $68.54, another big position....great it is going down, I am out at $68.23 for a .21 profit, but Stock X is moving again...damn! Ok, back long Stock X at $4.85, even bigger position...Yes! It is at $5.02!  Gonna hold....wait...fuck...no...how the hell did it just drop 60 cents in one candle!!  WTF!  Ok, I am out at $4.42....loss of .43 cents.  Ugh I should have just stayed Short for Stock Y, it's now at $67.24!!  Arghhhhh Stock X is back over $5 again, why did I get out?!?!  Now I am way down.....ok, fine...no problem, just going to go back into Stock X and leave it on this time.  What??  I don't have enough buying power now??  Ok, OTM Options on TSLA, if TSLA hits 900 by Friday I will have made it all back.*

Obviously everyone loses their damn mind differently so there are many variations on the shitstorm I just described, but they all have one thing in common....every trade is a gamble.  They are rushed, over-sized, and do not follow any method.  You are just searching for anything to get back to even at that point.  *All you want to do is erase your mistake.*  In fact you begin praying to some made-up Trading God at this point, sounding like a college kid that drank too much and promising they will never touch another drop as long as they live.  "If I can just make back this money I swear I will never screw-up again, I just have to get back to even."

To give some context to this, let's assume you have a $30,000 account that was a combination of your hard-earned savings and some good trading over the past year.  For some it could be an account of $5,000 and for others it might be $500,000 - it is all relative.  For this example, we'll use $30K.  And let's imagine the initial *Big Loss* knocked the account down to $24,000 and then the resulting temporary insanity took out another $6,000.  So in total the mistakes you made cost you $12,000, almost half.  Now you are under $25K, and shell-shocked.   The mental issue you need to deal with at this point is one of *Relative Value*.  The proper thing to do would be to slowly rebuild the account, re-focusing and settling for small wins.  But when you are trying to get back to even, the idea of profiting $80 on a trade seems frivolous at this point, doesn't it?  When you were on tilt, $80 was a few ticks in your Stock X trade, virtually meaningless, and now it is a goal??  On top of that you no longer trust yourself.  Part of you feels terrible because you are thinking of all things you could have done with that $12,000.  If you have kids you feel even worse, because you think of everything you could have gotten them, all the times you said "No, it's too expensive" when they wanted something.  In essence, you feel like total crap.  Another part of you feels obligated to make back the money, and quickly, but as mentioned, you just don't trust yourself not to fuck it up again.

This is a total mind-fuck.  Reading the Wiki, focusing on methods, studying chart....none of that is going to fix the meltdown in your psyche at that moment. 

**Finally Stage 3: The Aftermath**

How you handle coming out the other side of these downward spirals is extremely important.  If you can't pull yourself out of the *I must make it all back RIGHT NOW* mindset you will soon be left with an entirely busted account.

So what should you do?

**Step 1:** Step away.  This is really hard because you just want to jump back in.  If you can't walk away (and some can't) then only *paper trade until you completed the rest of the steps.*

**Step 2:** Formulate a goal. Open a spreadsheet and put in your goal, which in this case is $12,000.  Select a reasonable amount of time, let's say 30 Days. That gives a daily goal of $400 per day in profit.  Put a countdown on this sheet as well, so at the end of each day you can reduce the amount needed (e.g. by the end of day two, if you hit goal both days, you would have $11,200 remaining), this helps you see the progress.  

**Step 3:** Set rules.  For example - No trading any stock under $5, no trading After-hours, no trading before earnings unless it is a time-spread, etc.  On the opposite side of the coin - only trade the *Highest Probability Trades* (see the post from u/onewyse for examples of these).  And since there are roughly 3 of these a day, that means you need to make roughly $133.33 per trade.

**Step 4:** Practice steps 2 and 3 using a Paper Account until you are able to hit your goals for 5 straight days.

**Step 5:** Enact your plan using real money.

This entire process should take you roughly 2 to 3 weeks complete, which also gives your brain time to reset.  

As much as we want to avoid these downward spirals they are going to happen, and as long as they do your focus needs to be on stopping the bleeding, resetting your mindset and then reversing the damage.

**What about avoiding these meltdown completely?** 

That takes a somewhat larger adjustment.   Your ability to avoid **Stage 1** occurs when you finally reach the level of having a consistent trading plan that you stick with day after day.  Still, even full-time Day Traders have times where they suffer an out-sized loss, or get too confident after an out-sized win.  The only way to truly remove these triggers from your trading is to have hard rules that you stick by no matter what.  

One such rule is a **Max Loss** \- after your account hits that loss for the day you immediately stop trading.  Whether you get up and walk away at that point, switch to paper trading, or just spend the time going through charts depends on you, but the important thing is *stopping*.  Some people ask their broker to restrict the account after a max loss level is hit so they literally *can't* trade.  On the other side of the coin if you had an extraordinarily good day/trade then you immediately cut your position size in *half* for the remainder of the day.

If you are not at the point where you can entirely avoid **Stage 1** then it is a matter of recognizing the triggers for what they are - e.g. if you know that you go on tilt after you are hit with a large loss, then you *must* stop trading for the day (or two days, depending on how long it takes for you to calm the fuck down).

Avoiding these disasters is very much a rule-based regime that only works insomuch that a trader sticks to those rules.

Psychologically some people are more prone to these situations than others.  The predisposition to spiral out-of-control is not something easily fixed.  Odds are that this characteristic has always permeated through various aspects of your life.  The key to *fixing* it is to recognize that you are prone these meltdowns, identify the triggers that set you off, and then sticking to the rules you put in place as guardrails against it.

Best, H.S.
