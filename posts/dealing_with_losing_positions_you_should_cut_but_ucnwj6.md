There are several posts in the Wiki about the technical reasons you should cut a losing trade, as well as dealing with the psychological barriers to taking the loss. 

Cutting winners too soon and holding losers too long is without a doubt ***the number one issue in trading***.  ***Full Stop.***

This post is meant to give a simple, alternative suggestion if nothing else has worked.

The affliction of holding on to losers for too long is sometimes an issue with reading the technical landscape correctly, but it also *almost always* also has a psychological component.

As an example, let's say you took a trade and it cost you $1,000 - perhaps a $5 Call Option and you bought 2 of them.  After two days the trade has gone against you and the Option is now worth $2.50.  And even though stock broke through a technical line of Support/Resistance which nullified your original reason for taking the trade, you continue to hold on to the losing position. 

At this point you will justify holding it in as many ways as you can find, "it's the market dragging it down, and once SPY pops back up, so will this stock!" or "it is a volatile stock and it can jump back up at any moment, I don't want to miss it!" 

A trader holding a trade well past its prime can conjure up any number of reasons for staying in the position.

In reality, it isn't the trade one is emotionally attached to, it is the money.  The trade itself is a vehicle for the money.  So in this case, you are looking at $500 sitting in a losing trade, hoping it turns around.

So if all else fails, and you are psychological stuck when this happens then simply - ***Swap out the Trade***.  

Find the best trade you can for that $500 remaining, and then close your losing trade and immediately enter the one you found.  Now you still have that $500 sitting in a trade, but it is in a much better position than before.

If you swapped out every trade that you should cut,- you would be left with trades that are working *for you* and not *against you*.

Again, there are posts in the Wiki about the technical reasons to cut the trade, and if you have no psychological block in this regard that is exactly what you should do.  If you do have a block, there are posts on how to overcome it as well. 

But if all else fails - just ***swap them***.

  

Best, H.S.
