As I have mentioned, like most full-time traders, I have several different trading accounts.

One is for **Day Trading** (obviously), one is for using the **Fig Leaf** strategy, and one is for **Stocks/Long-Term Investments**.

While the **Fig** account stands separate - the other two feed into each other which allows for a very high win-rate and profit-factor.

As an example - let's say I go long 500 shares of **TGT** at $225 with a profit target of $227 - so I am looking to make $1,000 on the trade. **TGT** is strong, has *Relative Strength* and is currently in the strongest sector (Consumer Defensive) - any rebound in SPY will take **TGT** with it and secure my profits, while any drop in SPY will buffer **TGT** due to its' *Relative Strength*.   

I am bullish overall on the stock given the daily chart, and would remain bullish unless it dropped below $205 (which is filling the gap from March 1st). 

Let's say the market continues to drop and **TGT** closes at $223.25, meaning I am down $1.75 on the trade. Then the next day the market continues to drop even more and/or the sector rotates out meaning **TGT** drops again, this time to $221, right above its' 100 SMA.   

At this point, as long as the stock remains above $205, I set a DCA schedule for **TGT** at every two weeks, buying an additional 100 shares at whatever the price is at that time.  **TGT** is now part of the **Stocks/Long-Term Investment** account with the caveat - the moment the price of **TGT** returns a $1,000 profit, I sell it.  Until then, I DCA every two weeks - unless it falls below $205, in which case I take the loss.

There is also an exception here - at a certain point, if I am holding a stock for an extended period of time (i.e. **MU**), the calculation of where my "stop" would be now includes an element of Fundamental analysis as well.   What is the guidance?  Forward P/E? PEG? Etc.  In these cases the "stop" may be widened out to beyond that Technical break.

This then divides the stocks in the **Long Term Investment** portfolio in the following categories:

**Absolute Holds** \- these are stocks I simply want to hold long-term, barring any significant, impactful event.   Premium and market depending I will usually sell far OTM Calls on these holdings.  I never had **PTON** but that is the type of *impactful event* that would remove a stock in this category from my portfolio.

**Technical/Fundamental Holds -** these stocks were originally Day Trades but I have continued to accumulate shares given positive Fundamental information.  The profit target on these remains, but has been raised above the original goal.  Thus, if **TGT** were to fall into this category, the profit target may be raised to $3,000.  Given the potential of the stock hitting the target on any given week, Calls are rarely sold against these positions.  

**Target-Based Holds** \- Recent Day-Trades that now have a lower cost-basis and maintain the original profit target - these stocks tend to rotate out of the **LTI** holdings within 1 to 2 weeks (i.e. **GIS** today).  

***Keep in mind roughly 90% of all my Day Trades are closed either the same day or within 48 hours.  This process is for the 10% that weren't closed for a profit (or a loss).***  

**Note:** *This is not a process one can do without appropriately-sized accounts across the board.*

Overall, this method has returns between a 90-95% win-rate - however, part of that is due to the length of time I am able to *Dollar Cost Average* these shares and hold them.  

The other group of the stocks within the **LTI** portion of my trading portfolio comes from *selling Puts* \- and ***I never sell a Put unless I want the stock***.  ***When I sell a Put I am hoping to get assigned!***  If for example, I sell the $165 Puts on **NVDA** for $5, expiring this Friday, and **NVDA** finishes the week at $168 - I bank $5 into **NVDA.**  The next week I try it again, this time with higher premium and get $7, and again **NVDA** stays above - I now have $12 banked.  Finally, the third week I sell the $165 for $6, and **NVDA** finishes the week at $160, thus, I am assigned.  Well, I now have $18 in profit on that stock, so my cost-basis is $147 - and I own it at $160, meaning I am up $13.  If I want this as a Long-Term Investment, then I will sell calls against it.  If I put it into the middle category I might set a target of $25 profit, and therefore have a sell order in for $172.

With the **Fig Leaf** account  it is very market dependent - for example, if I were to buy LEAPs on Tech stocks right now, I would need to sell the calls very close to ATM given the current market.  However, if I were to buy a LEAP on **TGT** I would sell the calls at roughly .10 Delta given the sector strength.  The general rule is you want to pay for your LEAP using the short calls within 6 months.  After that whatever is remaining in the LEAP, either above or below the price you bought it, becomes your profit.

Obviously it is useful to have a partner (my wife) helping me manage all of these accounts, as I am also managing the *challenge accounts* as well.

Anyway, I thought I would explain this with a bit more clarity as I tend to get questions like, "Wait, aren't you averaging down?" or "Why are you still holding that position?".  So, now you know!

Best, H.S.
