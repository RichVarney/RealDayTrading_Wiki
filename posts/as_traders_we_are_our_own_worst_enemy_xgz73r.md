**If anything I ever write gets through to you, I hope it will be this post.**

*We Are Our Own Worst Enemy* 

You all know I passionately dislike people, so it should come as no surprise that this post is focused on flaws within the human condition.  There really just so many one can choose from one, but I will try my best to stay focused on those relevant to your trading, I promise.

Let me start with an example, one you may have heard used in some form of critique or another in the past. As a warning, this may sound a bit, "When I was a kid I walked to school barefoot, uphill both ways, in the snow" but bear with it - 

If you go back in time, just a bit, to the 1980's perhaps - information was **not** readily available.  If you needed something for school you had to go to a public library to get it.  And libraries, as amazing as they were/are, could be limited in how much knowledge they held within those walls.  However, most of the time you were stuck with what was geographically convenient to obtain.

And if you were having trouble with a class, you might get a tutor and hope that the limited time (and money) spent would be enough to help you pass that test. 

In other words, everything was difficult - although, of course, we did not know it was difficult back then, as there was no frame of reference.   Hell, we thought we were lucky!  I mean it wasn't like we were living through the archaic 70's and 60's!!

**But now?** Everything that took so much time and effort back then is readily available in the palm of our hands.  Library? No need - we have Google.  Tutors? No point - there is YouTube.  Almost anything we could ever want in terms of knowledge is a few clicks away.

So you would think that the average graduation rates, test scores, etc. would have gone up, right? No.  They have either stayed the same or in many cases declined.  

*How could that be?* The answers are literally in our phones, and yet we are no better academically now then we were then.  

*Why?* **Because our mindset is the same.  Our attitude towards learning is the same.**  As a result, all the added advantages in the world did not change the outcome. We remain as uneducated as ever.  It stands to reason that as technology improves, and knowledge becomes even more readily available - we shall still remain as ignorant as ever.  In other words, the problem lies in *how we learn* and our views towards *learning in general*. 

*So what does this have to do with trading?*  Well, let's go back in time again, to the 1990's or even early 2000's.  Traders were paying huge commissions, with extremely wide-spreads *(right now if you want to trade* ***AAPL*** *Calls that were ATM, you might have a bid of $5.10 and an ask of $5.30 - but imagine it was $5 and $6 instead - huge difference)*, they also had to depend on their broker to make the trades which was done over the phone (or by fax!), and by the time they got the information on a stock's price it was already out-of-date.  

In other words, much like school, trading was a lot more difficult back then, with a ton of obstacles in their way.  They didn't have access to reams of data or indicators, no minute-to-minute charts, they couldn't run instant reports for almost any comparison, and there certainly wasn't any commission-free trades or instant executions, etc.  

So once again, you would think that now with all the advantages we have that the percent of traders that make money would have increased from back in the stone-age, right?  I mean the average retail trader with a ThinkorSwim platform has access to more (and faster) information that the entirety of *Goldman Sachs* back in 1999.  Clearly this has to have made retail traders better, right?? I'm sure you know the answer.  No - it hasn't.  The same percent of traders fail now as they did, the only difference being - there are just a lot more of us now. In fact, it is fair to say 90% of traders lose money, and that might be generous. \****Now to be clear - a large portion of that 90% are traders that are untrained and quit after a short period of time. There is no way of knowing what percent of trader succeed if they put in the time, energy and dedication into learning how to properly trade.***  ***But still, there is no doubt that more traders lose than win.***

**Let's face it - as people - we suck.**  

Just like with schooling, if the problem was one of knowledge and access, then you would expect to see improvements as information becomes easily available.  

It stands to reason that you want to be doing what the 10% or 5% do rather than imitate the habits of the vast majority that go broke.  But that isn't what happens.

Even the method taught here, one that is proven to be successful, is not enough to make you profitable.  In fact, I could teach 100 people this method front and back until they know it by heart.  They could in fact be experts - *and still most would lose money.*

And is because you need both.  **Mindset** without knowledge is just as worthless as **knowledge** without mindset.  Only together does the two produce profitable results.  This is one of the reasons it takes the two years of training - *not just to learn the method, but to fix your mindset*.  It is also why such a large portion of this sub is dedicated to teaching **mindset**.

***So what is our major malfunction?*** 

Well the first problem we have isn't just that our mindset is faulty but also that *we don't realize it*.  We always think the problem is with a lack of knowledge - that is why we are constantly on the hunt for the next new indicator, the next course/guru - whatever shiny object that promises us the gold at the end of the proverbial rainbow.  Sadly when we get there we find that there is no gold, there isn't even a leprechaun - just another YouTube video featuring some guy in a rented Lambo. 

We don't want to think the problem is *us.*  Blaming everything else is far easier.  Many turn into those annoying trolls you see on these forums claiming the entire thing is fixed or scam.  Others go down the indicator rabbit hole. Sadly, most just whimper away with bruised egos, never to be seen again.

***But the problem*** ***is us*** ***and*** ***always has been******.***  

A recent study came out and revealed that a vast majority of retail traders are *dip buyers*, which means they are counter-trend trading.  We also know that a vast-majority of traders lose money.  Logically one would come to the conclusion that, as a trader, one should not do what the *vast majority* does.  Logically.  

Those that aren't *dip buyers* tend to buy *low-float gappers*, always chasing that elusive *short-squeeze*. We also know that most of those people *lose money*.  Logically one would come to the conclusion that, as a trader, one should not do what everyone else is doing.  Logically.

We also know that even those that avoid the temptation of *dip buying* and *low-float gappers*, are using some method of *Technical Analysis*.  Whether it is the dreaded *RSI*, or *Bollinger Bands,* perhaps throw a little *Macd* in for good measure, with a dash of *Fib lines -* they have some method that if they just perfect they can finally start turning a profit.  But most never do.  Once again, logic should come into play here as well. 

I think the follow might best illustrate what the **real** problem is:

Let's say I am short **META** \- it is a decent short right now and very defensible.  **META** has a horrible looking daily chart and the market is also bearish.  

So let's say I have the $155 Strike Puts that Expire 9/30 which cost $10.75.

On Monday the market bounces up and **META** goes up with it.  A few hours into trading and **META** is up $3 on the day and those Puts are now worth $7.30, you're down $3.45 a contract. But the stock is still Bearish on the daily chart and this is probably just a temporary bounce in an otherwise Bearish market.  So you hold your position.

On Tuesday the market continues to bounce and is now over $400 - **META** jumped up at open and is now at $155, and those contracts are worth $3.75 - down $7.  Now you are stuck.  You can take a 65% loss or just hold it, hoping that when FED comes out on Wednesday the market will drop, taking **META** down with it.  So that is what you do - you hold.  

On Wednesday the FED announces a .75 rate hike and the market goes up! Why? Because they have been pricing in the chance of 1pt rate hike, so .75 is actually an upside surprise.  **META** is now at $159 and those Puts are worth $2.   Finally out of frustration you close the position down $8.75 per contract.

*And don't give me this holier than thou crap about "They should have closed the position on Monday!" or "They were an idiot for holding and deserve to lose", as if* ***you*** *would have done it different.  The fact is - the above scenario is pretty much exactly what happens to a vast majority of traders, but no I am sure* ***you*** *are the exception.*

Naturally, come Thursday the market starts to drop again and continues dropping well into the next week.  By the time expiration comes up (9/30) those Puts would have been worth $20.75, almost twice what this trader originally paid.

Ok - now let's look at the reverse scenario - on Monday the market drops, taking **META** down with it - those $10.75 Puts are now worth $12 on market open.  The trader immediately takes profit, very happy that they are up $1.25.  As expected, **META** continues to decline and by Wednesday morning those Puts are now worth $20.75, almost twice what they paid.

***And within that example lies a core mindset issue***.

When the position goes against the trader, they neither shut it down immediately, nor do they stick to their thesis - instead they take a middle ground of *almost* maximum loss, with no chance of recovery.

When the position goes in favor of the trader, they have *no faith* that it will continue to do so, and immediately take profit.

The moment our positions are in profit, we tend to feel almost *lucky -* and our immediate instinct is to **lock-in** those winnings.  Perhaps we remember too many times in the past where positions have reversed on us, or maybe we internalized the notion that "One never goes broke taking profits" (yeah, you do....all the time), or perhaps we just want the "win".  Either way, at the moment when we are at the highest probability to continue making money we cut it off at the source.  We don't hold, and we almost never add to it, **we close it**.  

Name one successful person, company, or endeavor that has done well using the philosophy of "**Quit while you're ahead**".  Can you imagine if a sport team suddenly gave up mid-way through the game while they were up on their opponent? Or a business that shuts down the moment they start turning a profit?  Bring it down to an individual level even - imagine you finally get the nerve to ask that person you have liked, out on a date.  They say yes!  And then you don't show up.  Quit while you're ahead, right?  

In fact, there is one instance where one *should* **quit while they are ahead** \- ***Gambling***. In gambling you *shouldn't be ahead* \- the edge is against you.  So you if you are up, then you were lucky. In that case it makes perfect sense to quit while you're ahead.  

Which is deep down why we do it in trading - because most of us believe they are getting *lucky* when they are in profit.  They don't have any *real confidence* that they used a repeatable & winning method, they don't truly believe it was *skill* that produced the win.  That is why they think it is going to be reversed.

And this is one of the many reasons why we *suck*.  When it truly is luck (i.e. in a casino), we push forward and gamble even bigger when we are up, almost never *walking away*.  And when it is actually skill (i.e. when trading), we immediately take profits as fast as we can.

But that alone isn't enough.  Our capacity to screw ourselves over knows no bounds, truly.

Because the parallels to gambling does not stop when we are in profit.  

When a gambler is down, rather than think, "Well that makes sense, the odds are against me to begin with....", they instead go to the ole' , "I was just unlucky, and it *has* to turn around!".  Which generally is followed by a trip to the ATM where they pay a ridiculously high fee and head back out into the casino ready to "win it all back".

Similarly when a trader is down they believe it is always on the verge of "turning around".  Their big fear is that the moment they close their position is also when it will finally go in their direction (n*otice that the inverse is not true - because when a trader is up and closing the position, they don't worry that it will continue to go in their direction after they take profit).* 

***So here we have a huge logical contradiction.  When someone's skill is validated (i.e. when the position goes in the intended direction), they act as if it was luck and get out.  But when someone's skill is invalidated, they act as if they are still right and hold.*** 

**In other words -** ***When we trade, we act like gamblers.***  

This is a *Skill-based* profession, and in order to excel in a skill-based field you need to not only have that skill, but also believe in it as well. 

Like most professional traders, I know what the average amount of profit I make per trade.  Which means I also know that if I make a certain number of trades a day,  I will hit my monthly targets.    

For example, if I know on average I make $200 per trade (which averages in the winners and losers), and I want to make $40,000 a month in profit - then as long as I average 10 trades a day, I have confidence I will hit that number.   Some trades might lose a few thousand, some might make a few thousand, but with a dataset of thousands of trades that goes into that $200 average, I can be assured that it will all average out in the end.

Now, in order for that to work, my decisions have to be consistent, which means *fear* or *greed* or any other emotion has to be removed as much as possible.  Each decision needs to be based on the same criteria as the decision before it, and those after it.  

That is the only way one can make a living doing this.  And that **mindset** is about as far from acting like a *gambler* as you can get. 

So is that it? We need to stop acting like *gamblers*?  Well it is a start, but sadly, only just that....a start.

Ask yourself - 

*Sticking with* ***META*** *let's say on Monday is opens down $3.50 and immediately drops another $2.  The stock is now at $141.25.  Do you think:*

***It already dropped a lot, I missed it***

***This is a good time to go long, it is going to bounce***

If the answer to either of those is, Yes - then you have a **mindset** issue.

*If on Tuesday, and at the end of day* ***NFLX*** *is now on its' third straight day of increases, at $260, up from $235 just three days prior. Do you think:*

***There is going to be some profit-taking here, time to short it***

***I can't go long, it has to be over-extended by now***

Once again, if the answer to either of those is, Yes - then you have a **mindset** issue.

In fact, ask yourself, honestly - how many of the following apply to you:

***You are more likely to go long a stock that just dropped, rather than on one that has just gone up.***

***You are more likely to average-down than average-up.***

***You almost never average-up.***

***You find you either leave positions way too quickly, or way too slowly.***

***Your losses are far bigger than your winners.***

***At least once a week you have exited positions because of impatience.***

***At least once a week you have exited positions because you were losing too much money.***

***Your position sizes are clearly looking for big-wins.***

***You get stuck in positions where you are so far down that you can't bear to close it.***

***At least once a week you spend several hours staring at the same chart hoping it turns around.***

***At least once a week you made a trade out of FOMO, chasing a stock and/or jumping in too quickly.***

***More than half of your trades are against the market direction.***

***You're always betting on a reversal of some sort.***

***You're constantly adding new indicators or trying a new method.***

***You start out following your method/checklist, but by the time the day is done you find it has all gone out the window.***

***You follow the trades of others only to get stuck in them and dependent on someone else for your exit.***

***At least once a week you make a trade you do not fully understand how it works.***

***You find that all of your profits are consistently being wiped out by that one "big loss".***

***Your confidence is not consistent - you are either over-confident or lack-confidence.***

***When you are in profit your first thought is on closing the trade and taking the win.***

**ALL** of those above are issues with **Mindset**.  You can soak up more knowledge, learn more technical analysis, immerse yourself in charts all day, and it won't fix any of the above.

You are quite simply not thinking correctly - in fact, you are thinking just like *everyone else*.  And if it not clear by now, then let me say it plainly - **You can't not be a successful trader by thinking like everyone else that trades.**  

***You need to think like the 5-10% that are profitable, not the majority which are not.***

In the Wiki are posts that go into detail about how to solve the various mindset issues people have, and this post is long enough, so I encourage you to read: [Top 5 Mindset Issues and The Solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/v23nis/top_5_mindset_issues_and_the_solutions/) , this post is meant to drive home a very clear point - **You DO have a mindset issue and it is why you aren't profitable**.  

Once you finally realize this and actually focus on the problem, is also the moment you have a chance at over-coming it and becoming a profitable trader.

Best, H.S.
