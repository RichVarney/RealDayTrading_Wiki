Since I first posted the idea of doing a "Walk-Away" analysis I have received constant positive feedback from members on how it has helped them with their trading.

(Post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rs9x9f/walk\_away\_analysis/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rs9x9f/walk_away_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

The more I thought about it, the more it became clear that this analysis can get at the heart of any issues you maybe having with your trades.

Consider this - statistically there is no reason that a majority of the people trading should lose money.  Even if you chose your position through a random draw, your odds of making a profit should be 50-50 (even better if your positions were always bullish, and assuming you are not including any gambling-type OTM Option trades).  But we all know the reality is far from 50-50.  Also, when you consider the amount of analysis that goes into picking a trade, the actual results are even more shocking.

Which means the reason why so many people are losing, lies primarily within their exits.  Taking profit too early and staying in losers too long will always add up to a net result in the negative. 

The original analysis asked you to look at your closed trades and see what your P&L would have been if you had stayed in those trades until the end of the day (closing them right before the bell).  I suggest an expansion to that.  Create a worksheet that has the following:

*Columns:*

**Ticker**

**Long or Short**

**Debit or Credit**

**Stock, Option or Spread**

**Price Entered** 

**Price Exited**

***Total Profit or Loss***

**Price 5-Min After Exit**

***Total Profit or Loss 5-Min***

**Price 1 Hour After Exit**

***Total Profit or Loss 1 Hour***

**Price End of Day**

***Total Profit or Loss End of Day***

**Price End of Second Day**

***Total Profit or Loss Two Days***

**Price End of Week**

***Total Profit or Loss End of Week***

At the bottom (after the last ticker) put in:

***Win-Rate % - Number of winning trades divided by total number of trades***

***Total Profit or Loss - Sum of profit or loss of all trades***

To begin with if you are not making a profit no matter which time-frame you are looking at then the issue is with the trades you are picking.  No amount of patience or trade-management can fix a problem that lies within the very thesis itself.  *This is important information to know.*

If your P&L is highest just 5-minutes or 1 hour after you exited, your issue is being faked out by a false move, typically because you are using stops that are way too tight.  *Loosen them up.*

If your P&L is highest at the end of the day or end of the second day that most likely means you are not leaning enough on the daily chart and giving your trade room to breathe.  The *noise* is taking up too much of your focus, rather than the *signal*.

If your P&L is highest at the end of the week, you are choosing the right stocks, but seem to be far too early, or trading against market conditions.  

Obviously with Option positions the more time you wait the more they lose value outside that of intrinsic value, so if this analysis shows a higher P&L on the later time-frames for those instruments, it highlights the issue even more so than if it were just stocks.

Over 94% of my trades turn into winners - Why? Because I am picking the right stocks, it is just a matter of *when* they will become profitable.  Identifying whether the issue lies in the trades you're choosing, or the manner in which you are exiting them can be *very* eye-opening.

I suggest using at least the last 50 trades to do this analysis. 

Very curious to see the outcome!

Best, H.S.
