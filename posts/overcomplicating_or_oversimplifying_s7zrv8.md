I see this issue crop up more and more - 

Here are the two extremes:

**Over-Thinking:**

Trader waits for the *perfect entry* where all indicators are green -Pullback to 8EMA, 3/8 cross, confirmation candle, bullish SPY, RS on stock, good volume, strong daily chart.  

And waits for the *perfect exit* once again looking primarily at the indicators - meticulously placing their stops, waiting for a loss of RS and a decline in volume - a bearish turn on SPY, confirmation of the drop, etc.

**Over-Simplifying** 

Trader sees a stock going down, sees the market going down, sees a weak daily chart and immediately shorts the stock.

*Believe it or not - both ways have their pros and cons.*

The problem with the first camp (*Over-Thinking)* is that not one size fits all. Perhaps you shorted **NVDA** and SPY bounces up, **NVDA** gets some RS and begins to climb hitting your stop.  However, what if there is a general overall sector weakness for **NVDA**? What if that was just a short-covering bounce? There is a tremendous amount of *noise* that a checklist method can interpret as a real *signal*. 

The issue with the second method (*Over-Simplifying)* is far more obvious - making a quick judgement call based only on looking at the current direction means you may have missed something, and perhaps several things.  Perhaps there is an Algo line right above the price, but because you jumped in, you did not take the time to draw it?  Maybe **SPY** is coming up against a significant SMA and the bounce is temporary?

*Interestingly traders tend to gravitate to one of these two types of trading.*

Over-thinking gives a new trader a sense of control - it gives order to a complex activity.  *As long as you follow these clear steps, you should make profit a majority of the time* \- **that** is a very appealing sentiment.  So traders will make rules, list them out, even print them out - and follow them to the letter. 

Over-Simplifying has its' own appeal - you don't have to do much work, you just need to look and see a bunch of red bars on the stock, and on **SPY**, see a weak daily chart and off you go.  Hell, it has a better chance of dropping then going up, right?

*Obviously the more experience you have the more you are able to just look at a chart and make your decision - you will see the trendlines and the natural progression of the stock.  With experience, the* ***story*** *of the stock becomes clear with just a quick view.* 

So what is the answer?  

New and struggling traders should *absolutely* err on the side of the *Over-thinking.*  **However, there is a huge caveat** \- *trading is a dynamic activity, conditions change, and you need to adjust with it.*

You can not be so rigid that you are unable to see where the rules you laid out no longer apply.  Following an unshakable set of rules can prevent a trader from seeing the larger picture. 

So I suggest the following - you have your rules - you have your checklist - but add one thing to it - this question: *What is the story of this stock right now*.

You need to be able to answer that question and *then* apply your rules within that context.  

For example - if you are short a *Tech* stock right now, you are aware earnings are coming up, and the stock typically surges into earnings, but right now it is weak, the sector is weak, and the market is weak - you short the stock.  But it begins to go up, gaining RS - all of your checkboxes for an exit are lighting up - **but** you also know that there is major resistance right above the price, and another stock in the sector that is similar (e.g. **MRVL** & **NVDA**) just reported weak earnings.  This may give you pause on your exit and thus, give the stock more room to ride out the bounce.

Much like driving - the speed limit says 55, but you are in traffic and everyone else is going 65 - do you still follow the sign that says 55 and rigidly stick to the letter of the law, or do you adjust and keep up with the rest of the cars?
