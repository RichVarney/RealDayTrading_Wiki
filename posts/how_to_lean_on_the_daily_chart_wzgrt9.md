About a month or so ago I had a brief conversation in the Option Stalker chatroom and it made me realize that we have not really discussed what leaning on the daily chart truly means or how to do it. I am worried that there are some traders that are holding onto their losers too long and ignoring the price action. I would feel very guilty if I was somehow responsible for people having blind faith in their trades and in the same token, I want everyone to feel very confident in their trading too.

First let’s build your confidence in your stock selection using the walkaway analysis: **Step 1 review your trades**

So by now you have read the wiki and are really familiar with the walkaway analysis - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rs9x9f/walk\_away\_analysis/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rs9x9f/walk_away_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) . If you are not take the time to review it and come back to this article. I have also made a google sheet to make the walk away analysis automated so you can review your past trades. [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/slg8ip/hot\_automated\_walk\_away\_5\_day\_trade\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/slg8ip/hot_automated_walk_away_5_day_trade_review/)

After doing this review you will see that a lot of times holding onto your losers for a little longer would have made you much more profitable (especially if you follow the teachings of this community). This is largely due to the fact that this trading system relies on the strength of the Daily Chart.

**Step 2: Selecting Stocks w/ a strong daily chart**

What is a strong Daily Chart?

There are a lot of different answers to this really simple question as there are lots of different setups that different traders look for but I will attempt to answer this as simply as possible. *If you pretended that the Daily chart was a 5M chart, would you want to buy/short?* Things I look for in a strong daily chart is an obvious trend (sometimes I use HA candles), is the stock higher than yesterdays high, is it above its SMAs, and does it have daily relative strength to SPY (example COP).

**Step 3: Entering the Trade**

Enter your trades at a swingable size. For me this is half my intraday trading size \*this is my arbitrary rule\* but it is what I have grown comfortable swinging. This ensures that I can lean on the daily comfortably and gives me options and opportunities to further manage this position.  I can add to pullbacks if I miss-timed my entry and it gets me used to adding to winners when the trend is strong.

**Step 4: Managing the Position**

How I used to manage my positions

So lets say I have a position that I have the chance at making a profit on. I get all excited, I’m like jo-jo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet. The pet is my position, my pretty little pet, I love you. So I stroke it and I pet it and I massage it. Hee, hee, I love it. I love my little naughty pet. You’re naughty. Then I take my naughty pet and I go >>>

&#x200B;

How I manage them now:

Using the Tommy Boy analogy above I give my pet a treat when it does something I like (add to the position) and when it is naughty I take from that position.  I like to use several different levels (3/8 EMA cross, VWAP) to manage the position and it helps me make decisions on whether to add to the position, reduce the position (take profits), or take a loss on the position. Some of this correlates with my other post about market context as well : [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/wxzaes/using\_market\_context\_to\_determine\_whether\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/wxzaes/using_market_context_to_determine_whether_your/)

I will use a LONG position as an example but just know the opposite is true for SHORTS. I typically enter trades long that are above VWAP and showing relative strength to SPY.

3/8 EMA Cross: These can happen above and below VWAP and there can be several crosses a day. You can see them when consolidation happens and when big moves happen. These are pretty context sensitive so judgement is required. A good cross after some consolidation could signal the next move up so it is not a bad place to add. A bad cross can signal a good time to take some profits off.

High of Day: These are difficult for me sometimes because I have not found a fool proof method of determining when a new high will be made and when it is going to make a double top and reverse. I feel it comes down to intuition and years of watching charts. Add if you are confident and there is nice volume or watch to take profits if you are not…yeah I am not a whole lot of help here.

VWAP: Also context sensitive. If the stock is strong you can see this because it will not even test the VWAP that day but if you did not enter too far away from the VWAP odds are it will test it. If the stock breaks down below the VWAP and the bar closes below it that could be your first clue that the stock is no longer bullish. It could be time to leave or reduce your exposure.

**When to take a loss:**

The basis of your entry into this stock was based on the strong daily chart. If the daily chart ends the day that goes against your thesis and breaks down that daily chart it is time to take the Loss.

The Daily will close as a reversal candle w/ high volume closing below/above yesterday’s high/low

Yesterday I posted CROX: I did not swing it but if I did this is how one can interpret how to take the loss.

Would you hold or take the loss?

edit for  

**u/**[**superpantz**](https://www.reddit.com/user/superpantz/)

**Question (summarized): Leaning on the daily can result in larger loses as the stop tends to be larger.**  For example, if I win 9/10 trade risking $100 each trade and on average make $10 each trade, that 1 loss would take all the earnings.  

**Answer:  If you are adding to your winners (increasing from swing trading size to day trading size) you should be taking more on your winners and losing less on your losers.**  For example lets say that you have added to your winners and instead of making $10 a winning trade you are making $15.  9/10 trades you are now winning $135.  If you continue to lose the same amount you should be netting $35.  

**LET ME STRESS HOW IMPORTANT MARKET CONTEXT IS AND KNOWING WHEN TO LEAN ON THE DAILY VS. IDENTIFYING YOUR THESIS IS NO LONGER VALID.**

My most recent swing/ example of leaning on the daily was swinging a short for DASH.  I entered a DASH short based on the break of consolidation to the short side on 26 AUG.  Now I timed this entry horribly at possibly the lowest point of the day.

So in this example we have a stock that stayed near the VWAP during Market Chop, then we got a bogus news pump and dump, and we were finally able to take profit.  

It is late so I am calling it.  Keep the questions coming and I'll try my best to answer.  Good luck out there.
