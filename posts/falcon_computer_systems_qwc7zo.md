I recently bought a new trading rig from Falcon Computer System, where they custom build each computer and configure your trading software with it.

After using it for a week, I was so impressed that I called up the owner and asked for a partnership with them.  They agreed to not only put a link to RealDayTrading on their site, but also include a flier about our sub in all of the computers they send out, as well as offer a discount to our members here.

Obviously buying a computer set-up just for trading is an investment, and something only more serious traders are going to be considering - but for those that are thinking of going the four monitor, glowing desktop route - this is definitely where you should go:

Make sure you let them know that you are from RealDayTrading, and that Scott (the owner) said there would be a discount.  In a week or so, I believe their will be a code or something to make that easier.  

Once again, this is really for the more advanced traders that want to upgrade their hardware, but still it is a high quality product (which I am using myself), so I wanted to recommend it.  

As always I am not getting any financial benefit from that recommendation, nor did I ask for one - but, I am glad they are willing to give some $$ off to people here.

Best, H.S.
