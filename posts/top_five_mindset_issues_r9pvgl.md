In most fields, if you take the time to learn a skill, and then practice that skill, you will improve.    

Somethings are easier to master than others, but typically as long as you have a base level of intelligence, achieving success is combination of time and effort.  \**Areas that gauge success on physical performance or artistic ability, also requires a certain amount of talent.*

Become a consistently profitable trader is no different - it takes a tremendous amount of time and dedicated effort to get to the point where you can do this full-time.  However, there is one way that becoming a successful trader differs from other potential careers - the importance of ***Mindset***. Which isn't to say that "mindset" isn't important elsewhere, rather that it plays a much larger role when it comes to being a successful trader. 

When it comes to the importance of mindset, trading is more comparable to playing Sports professionally.  You can have all the talent and skill in the world, but in sports, if you can't perform under pressure, or in front of a crowd, you'll soon find yourself out of the game. 

I know some extremely knowledgeable traders, people who could literally write books on the topic - but whenever they try to trade themselves, they fail. They just can't do it.   

That is because unless you master the mindset of trading, all of the knowledge in the world won't help you make a profit.  This problem is fairly well recognized; there are plenty of books and online videos on the topic.  But as we all know, simply reading a book is not going to instantly solve your problem.  

In order to really talk about this issue, we must first identify what we are talking about - so here are the most common mindset problems traders face - and when you read these be honest with yourself as to how much each impact your ability to be profitable:

**Gambling** \- Let's get one thing out of the way up front - some of us are more prone to this issue than others.  We all know who we are.  A group of people can walk into a casino.  For some in that group their eyes light up as they hears the sounds of the slot machines and the cheers at the crap table - all they can think about it breaking away and converting the cash in their pockets to chips.  For others they are thinking about the shows they want to see, and where they can go to dinner.  And yes, there are some that think, "This is hell, pure hell, when can we leave?"  Gamblers know who they are - and live by the creed that "*money won is twice as sweet as money earned*".  I should know, I am one of them.  Still, even amongst the most gambling adverse it is hard not to feel like the market is one big casino.  You become detached from the money in your account, as if they are chips on a blackjack table.  It can almost feel like it's not real money.    The problem with this? When you start treating your trading as gambling, you begin to take unnecessary risks.  *Even worse, you start to think that is all luck* *anyway and begin rooting for your position to go up as if it was a racehorse you just bet on.* The more you see trading as simply, "gambling" the father away you become from being a consistently profitable trader.    

**Uncharmed Life -** Most of us, if not all of us, were not born into wealth.  Some may have done well for themselves in life, but it is a pretty safe bet that just about everyone reading this hasn't put millions of dollars into an off-shore account to avoid taxes.  Which means we *worked* for a living.  Nothing was handed to us, and everything we have we *earned*.  And we did this in an environment that was designed to keep us from accumulating that wealth.  The rules aren't fair and we all know it.  What this also means is that our lives have been filled with a lot of disappointment.  The other shoe is *always dropping*.  Over time this mentality becomes fossilized within us, and it is this - We are constantly hoping things get better, and always afraid we are going to lose what we have.  Think about it, when something good finally happens, do you enjoy it, or do you wind up worrying about when shit is about to go wrong again?  And how often do you spend you time hoping for something?  Whether it is a raise, a promotion, or winning the damn lottery.   Now take this mindset over to trading and what happens?  When you're in profit - what your first thought should be is - "I need to add to this and continue to grow my position", but what you actually think is, "I need to take profits now before it reverses".  And when your position is in the red, what you should be thinking is, "Is my money better spent in a different trade than holding on to this loser", but what you wind up thinking is, "It will turn around soon, it *has* to!".   See how the two mentalities cross each other?  You cut off your winners out of fear, and extend your losers out of hope, because this is what you do in day-to-day life.  

**Counter-Trend Trading -** This phenomenon is actually quite different from the others - because it *doesn't mimic real life*.  In real life, we tend to go with the trend; if it was 80 degrees yesterday and 80 degrees today, we aren't expecting it to be 40 degrees tomorrow, we like to bet on the hot sport team that just won 10 of their last 11 games, if we hear on the news that relations with a country is deteriorating we think things will get worse, if we hear that the economy is improving we think it will keep getting better (usually).  We live with the trends every day and go with them, trends provide order, structure and predictability to our lives.  Except in trading - in trading people try to do the opposite.  SPY is at an ATH, great - buy Puts.  PYPL is dropping? Time to get some OTM Calls!  We like to think we can outsmart the market.  And there is a reason for that - when we are right, it validates our feeling that we know more than everyone else and have "figured out" something.   Even though anything anyone could possibly think of is already built-into the price of the stock, that doesn't seem to matter.  And this type of self-delusion runs through an entire spectrum of stupidity - from "basic reasoning" like, "My kids and all their friends don't watch Netflix anymore, it is go to go down" to far more advanced DD that goes into the fundamentals of the stocks and sector.  Institutions spend hundreds of millions of dollar to investigate every possible scenario, run models on all them, and act accordingly - meaning whatever theory you have is already baked into the price.   More traders get burned with counter-trend trading than almost any other kind, except perhaps low-float scalping.  And it all stems from the need to feel that they can "beat the market", but in reality it is just laziness.  One *can beat the market*, with a lot of hard work and effort - not through just sitting around and thinking, "Elon is selling shares, Tesla is going to drop!".  *Buy High - sell Higher.  The Trend is your friend.*

**Confidence -** And of course, the old standby - basic, straight-up confidence. Traders that trade for a living have confidence in their statistics, they know that if they make enough trades, using the right set-up, that they will be in profit at the end of the month.  They have confidence during a huge drawdown in their trade that it will reverse, and equally have confidence when they add to a winning position. But even the best trader will have moments of doubt.  A batter can have a .375 average in the majors, but after an 0 for 20 streak, I guarantee you that self-doubt creeps in.  For new traders, or traders still trying to reach profitability, *confidence* can be a killer.  After a huge loss you want to give up, and think to yourself, "What am I doing? I am just throwing away my money - I could just put that money into AAPL and leave it there instead."  You begin to think that you're never going to *get it*, and every trade you make is steeped in fear.  When something goes against you it is almost expected, and you are shocked when something actually works out.  Even worse is when you finally think you *got it*, only to realize, *you don't have shit*. To make things worse, generally people in your life aren't supportive - which isn't exactly a boost to your self-esteem.  If you talk to any former trader that has given up you will find that at the heart of their decision to quit was a complete lack of confidence that they could do it.

**Over-Confidence -** Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, the opposite is also true.  I see it all the time, people come into this thinking they have it *all figured out*.  Everyone else is just an idiot, and if they just followed their basic method (it can truly be anything, from a three-bar system, to volume profiles and pivots, to even "gut feeling") they too can quit their job and be rich.  Chances are these traders bought some OTM calls on a stock and got very lucky.  Usually I hear stories that average out to roughly turning $3,000 into $30,000 on one trade.  Sometimes, they get lucky twice, and that $30,000 becomes $200,000 and they are flying high.  Without fail, those traders wind up losing the money they made, and then more on top of it.  *If this every happens to you, and you get this lucky - for the love of god, take that money out of your account now, put it into the bank, consider it a lottery win, and start learning how to really trade.*   This problem tends to be very short-lived because the market shows no mercy to arrogance.  Another way this problem manifests itself is in the belief that you do not need to put in the time and effort required to be successful at this.  Many people don't want to hear that do this is like trying to excel at any other career, you need to work your ass off.  So instead they are drawn to "quick fixes", these are the people that like to believe that one can spend 30 minutes a day trading and be done.  The notion of starting at the beginning and slowly building up your knowledge and strategies is a very foreign concept to them.  Just consider this - trading for a living offers complete and total financial freedom.  You have no boss (except yourself and maybe the market), you control your own destiny.  It truly is one of the best jobs in the world.  Now think about how hard one has to work just to get themselves into a middle-management position at some company that could let you go tomorrow and not miss a beat.  Chances are you went to college, got entry level jobs, worked your way up with various promotions and after many years found yourself in a small office making between $100 and $250K (if you are lucky).  Given that, how anyone could possibly think that a few YouTube videos and reading parts of one book is all the work they need to do in order to become a full-time trader, a far better job than just about any other out there?

So there you have it, these are five mindset issues that plague traders.  Any single one of them can supersede all the knowledge you have and make it impossible for you to become consistently profitable.   They all have solutions, which will be for another post, but first thing is first - you need identify which of these you have and look at how it has impacted your trading.  

I will soon post a follow-up to these, which will focus on how to deal with these mindset issues - but as I said, the first thing one must do is recognize them and come to terms with how each issue outlined above impacts their trading.

Best, H.S.
