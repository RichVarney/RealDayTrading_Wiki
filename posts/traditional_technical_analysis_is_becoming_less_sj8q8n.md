I did a post a couple of months ago on how traditional technical analysis has become much less effective over the last few years and went into the reasons why . [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rc6mfs/traditional\_technical\_analysis\_is\_becoming\_less/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rc6mfs/traditional_technical_analysis_is_becoming_less/)

The main points were that institutional trading (Banks Hedge Funds etc) with their algos is what determines price movement and trends, both when they are driving a trend and when they back off and let the retail traders come in . The algo know what the retailer traders are most likely to do at specific levels and indicator movements. I have found that technical setups that appear the same will sometimes work and many times fail (failing more frequently in recent years). The presence of institutions being in the trend make the trade much more likely to succeed and their absence make it more likely to fail. 

I have been a successful technical trader for 12 years using the traditional technical analysis and I love the trading community I am in, but i wanted to find a solution to this increasing failure of indicators and traditional technical analysis.  I spent several months looking for a way to quantify the presence or absence  of institutions in a trend and found software from Right Line Trading that did quantify institutional buying and selling. The way it achieves that is fairly complex. as you can imagine, but it is presented on a chart (in this case Think or Swim) in an easily identifiable format that is easy to interpret. I bought the software and began using it in conjunction with my usual technical analysis and it has been extremely effective both in identifying the best setups to trade. but more importantly, keeping me out of trades lacking institutional participation.  

I have been trading with the The Right Line Compass System for about 6 months and was so impressed on its effectiveness i joined their team on January 3rd. I certainly would not mention or recommend this software if i didn't believe in it effectiveness and use it myself.

Since i believe this will add value and improve ones trading i am including a link where i will go over the Compass System in a webinar on Saturday Feb 5th  at 1pm for anyone who would like to check it out. The webinar will be recorded for anyone who would like to see it but wont be available on Saturday.
