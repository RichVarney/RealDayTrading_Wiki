Alrighty, it's time to be real here. Maybe this will help you refine your trading resolutions for next year, but mostly I'm just going to write this down because I get asked a bunch of the same questions whenever I do a trading recap post (or if others do) - same questions all the time. Some from folks with good intentions, others that are just spinning their wheels and not putting in the right effort.

**Types of Knowledge**

Let's set the stage here. First of all, there are two basic types of knowledge of knowledge:

1. Book knowledge
2. Practical application

You might call these different things, but the basic distinction to realize is that is a huge difference between knowing something and being able to do something. You might "know" how to change a tire, but unless you've actually done it, you aren't actually *able* to do it.

Trading is no different, but so many people are just looking for that last "tip" or that "magic setup" or that "one more thing" that's going to turn them around.

STOP.

THERE IS NO MAGIC.

THERE IS ONLY A LOT OF HARD WORK, DETERMINATION, AND GRIT.

**The Process**

The wiki says it takes two years. Do you know why? You can read the wiki in a weekend. You can understand all of the words in it in less than a week. You can even make a few trades and make some money. Guess what? Doesn't matter.

The reason this takes time is because you need to convert all of that book knowledge into practical knowledge.

* You need to understand what it feels like to be down $2 on 100/500/1000 shares (in your paper account!!!) and keep holding it because the next support is still $3 away and your target level is still $6 away.
* You need to learn that a profitable trade isn't necessarily a good trade. Did you violate your rules? Did you hold it past your stop? Did you bail on it early? (I'm still bailing on trades too early!!! NVDA and TSLA today...)
* You need to learn that a losing trade can still be a good trade. Did you take the setup you like only to have it reverse due to a unforeseeable change in the market? Did you actually take it off and not bag hold it?
* You need to be able to, in real time, make a decision to enter a trade and have your **own convictions** on it. Don't enter a trade because Hari took it and then ask him two hours later when you're down $2k in your real account because you thought it was a sure thing since Hari is in it and now you're freaking out messaging him if he's still in the trade.
* Figure out how to apply the guidance of the wiki to your own style and needs. Each of us will develop a different style of trading even though we are following the same basic structure. Just look at Hari and Dave to see that illustrated perfectly. You need to figure out how *you* trade.
* Emotional damage - you're going to get it. How do you deal with it? A book might give you techniques to try, but you have to go through the motions.

**What you need to be doing**

It's already in the wiki! But I'll lay it out again:

* READ THE WIKI
* UNDERSTAND THE WIKI
* Start applying the things you're learning from the wiki in a paper account
* Make notes of why you entered the trade, where you are thinking it's going, why you are holding it when it moves against you, and why you are exiting the trade.
* Review these trades!
* Strategize a plan to fix the errors
* RINSE AND REPEAT

This is what you'll be spending your two years doing. You'll be getting in the reps and figuring out what trade setups work for you. What relative strength/weaknesses setups are the ones you like to take. Maybe you can't hold positions with big swings and you only enter positions that are $1 away from major support/resistance levels. Maybe you only take second day continuation trades. Whatever is it, you need to figure out what works for you.

I'm in a chat room with some folks - none of us trade the same way. NOT A SINGLE ONE OF US. Yet, we all use this same framework for our trades. 

**But paper trading doesn't work for me**

Make it. Seriously, the only reason it doesn't work for you is because you aren't actually treating it like a real account. Once you realize that if your monthly stats actually tell you that you aren't going to make it, then it changes. Because that's what it means. If you can't be profitable in an account where there is no "skin in the game", **you will not be profitable in a real account.** 

Imagine if a professional football player said they didn't need to go to practice to put in the reps. You think the coach is going to put them in to play in a real game?

**But I'm too busy, tired, exhausted, nothing is working, I just need...**

Listen, you can make any excuse you want. If this is something you want, you'll figure out how to make it work. I'm guessing I'm busier than the vast majority of you here, but I'm here every day getting those reps in. 

Some of you are going to be in much worse conditions than I am in; I get that, but the market doesn't care. *You must realize this*. Does it suck? Yeah, it does. But if this is what you want to do, you're going to have to figure out what works *for you* in order to make it work.

**Closing Thoughts**

If you've made it this far, I'll give you a brief summary of what I look for in my trades:

* Relative strength/weakness to the market
* Relative strength/weakness to the sector
* Parity with SPY (e.g. the stock is trading like SPY but it has bigger moves than SPY)
* VWAP fades after a double-top/bottom

I've practiced all of these setups, I know that if I take them when my other conditions align (price of stock, daily resistance levels, general market conditions, etc...), I have a good chance of getting a profitable trade. I know because I have my previous trade stats to back it up.

Lastly, if you think this post is too harsh? Frankly, I don't care. Every single piece of advice I've given up there applied to me at some point in time. You can either choose to accept that you need to put in both a lot of work and the *right type of work*, or don't and in a year or two from now, when you see a bunch of other traders making it, you'll still be asking the same questions and wondering why you are still stuck in place.
