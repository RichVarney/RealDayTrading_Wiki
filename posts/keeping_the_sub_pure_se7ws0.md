As many of you know this Sub is special.  It is a place where we see members *actually* improve everyday.  More than that, it has become a ***community***.

At our heart - this is a *teaching* community - where Pros and experienced traders teach a clear method that has proven time and again to result in *consistent profitability.*

I post every trade in real time, and do the challenges in real time, with full transparency to the trading log, to not only teach members how to trade correctly, but also to show *that it is possible*.

Given all the scams and misinformation out there, it is natural to be cynical about the notion that one can obtain financial freedom through trading.  Which is why so much effort is put into showing you that it *can* be done.  It is hard, it takes time and effort - but it is an achievable goal.

We are all here in service of that goal.  But as we expand, naturally some will come in without having the best intentions.

I, in no way, want to discourage criticism or discussion.  However:

1. We are very hesitant to entertain alternative methods here for a simple reason - *that is exactly what every other trading sub does*.  Everyone throws their "method of the week" against the wall, which turns into a orgy of bullshit and confusion.  Nobody knows what works and what doesn't.  Well, we know what we teach and put into the Wiki here, *works*.  So if you have something you truly feel is additive, you can message me and I will take a look - but don't post or comment with it.
2. We say "Read the Damn Wiki" because it truly is the most comprehensive guide on trading you will find.  It is free and available here.  Myself and the other pros cannot answer the same questions over and over, so when you ask a question that is in the Wiki, you will get the answer - RTDW.
3. Trolls and assholes are **not** tolerated.  I get it - many want to attack me.  Some even make fake accounts to come back again and again to do it.  It never works, and you only wind up looking bad.  But fine - that is what "Bans" are for - and we use Bans liberally here.  If you act like a troll, you are banned.  However, know that I give every single banned person a chance to show they mean to add value here, and I let them back in.  This has happened several times already and those people went on to become valuable members of the community.
4. Criticism and Discussions *is* encouraged.  If you read my trade reviews, trust me, nobody is harder on myself than me - I openly say when I screw up, and I *do* screw up.  You should be very *wary* of any trader that looks perfect and polished - they don't exist.  I mess up, I misread the market and trades.  Not often mind you, but it happens.   I try to respond to all criticisms and disagreements, as long as they are not meant to cause harm to myself, other members or this community.
5. We **are** a community.  I have one goal for the members here - **that you make money**.  Period. Full stop.  If someone is losing money or having a hard time, I expect this community to *support them*.  And yes, I may be a dick at times, and harsh to some - but it is because I don't want to see you *lose your money*.  We are in this together, and together we will succeed.   And if *anyone* is having an issue with someone else on other subs, feel free to send up the Bat Signal, and I would hope this community would respond like an army coming to help you.

It is *very* important we keep this place pure.  We have become the fastest growing trading sub on Reddit over the past year (and we aren't even a year old yet) for a reason.

In that spirit, I have asked the mods here to implement any rules about posting that can help keep our community what many have described as; not just the best trading sub on Reddit, but the *Best Sub* on Reddit or anywhere else.

Now...I see SPY is going up, which I have been saying it will, and I have profits to take.  I leave the rest to our amazing moderators.

Best, H.S.
