Most traders who have read my posts know i love strategies with defined risk and capture premium by selling options as part of the trade. These include credit spreads (puts or calls) debit spreads (puts or calls) and time spreads (a specific calendar spread strategy). 

One i have not posted before is what i call the WATM, or weekly ATM where ATM stands for at the money (i prefer automatic teller machine because of how effective this strategy is if structured correctly on the correct stocks.

The strategy requires stocks that have weekly options and have 6 weeks or more until earnings. The stock needs a neutral to bullish bias and needs to have a bullish catalyst to have occurred on it last earnings report that produced heavier then normal volume. With these elements in place we can then analyze the current weeks options to determine how much credit we can receive on the current weeks at the money puts. To justify putting the trade on for the stock the premium collected for the weekly puts being sold must be 1% or more of the stock price. So selling puts on a $100 atm strike must produce a premium of at least $1.00..

Now we are ready to initiate the trade. This is done by selling this weeks atm puts and buying lower strike puts out at least 8 weeks and preferably just beyond the next earnings date. The spread between the strike of the short puts and the strike of the long puts is your risk on the trade plus the debit you paid to put the spread on. So short $100 puts and long $95 puts (8 to 12 weeks out) creates a risk of $5 plus the debit to put the trade on. 

Now the trade is initiated and the normal strategy will be to keep rolling the weekly puts out week after week. If the stock moves up you would sell higher strike puts the next week, if it is flat you would sell the same strike puts as you did the first week. If the stock price drops and you technical bias is still neutral to bullish you would buy back this weeks puts at a loss and roll them out to the same strike for next week and keep doing this as long as the stock does not break below your technical support level, this approach allows you to recapture  the loss and capture puts premium for the next week that would put you back in profits.

Should the stock fall below your support level and your bias becomes bearish, you buy back the current weeks short puts and let you longer dated long puts run, so the long puts become a protective position for the trade.

As  said the difference between your long and short puts is your risk so if the stock moves up parabolically it is best to take profits since keeping your risk near what it was when you put the trade on would require selling the long put at a loss and buying another long put at a higher strike to control your risk. That can be done effectively if you have enough time to earnings to continue selling current weeks puts but my preference is to take profits after a big up move. 

You can probably see that the best candidates are stocks that move sideways for a time so you can keep harvesting the short put premium week after week

One note about buying long puts after earnings, you will initially pay more for the spread but those puts will retain more value because of the extra premium that is in them due to earnings volatility, so when you close the trade you will receive more premium than if the long puts expired prior to earnings. thus reducing you loss on the long protective puts.

&#x200B;

It is best to close the trade down once you get within 3 weeks of earnings or if you cant receive the 1% premium on your short at the money put. Generally after 2 weeks you will be in profits and they will increase from there if the stock price remains flat or bullish.

There are more nuances to the strategy but i have used it effectively over the years and just closed a nicely profitable WATM on AAPL that i held for only 2 weeks due to the over sized premiums in the puts.

I know this may sound complex but it really is just selling time each week with a protective put to limit your risk as well as limiting the margin needed.
