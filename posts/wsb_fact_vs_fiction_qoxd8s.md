It should be obvious, even to a new member, that this sub is the polar opposite of WallStreetBets.  

In fact, anyone that uses WSB vernacular (i.e. stonks, apes, wife's boyfriend, tendies, etc....) is subject to well-deserved ridicule.  In other words, if you act like an Ape, you will get smacked down faster than you can say, "Wendy's dumpster fire".

Still, the role of WSB in this community can not be denied - but it should be clarified.  

Their original intent was to create a sub that allowed members to post thoughts and trades which would be deleted elsewhere.  The mentality there was to treat the market as the world's largest casino and as such they encouraged risky bets.   Taking losses was a matter of pride, and posting about those losses, even more so.   

People lost money, a few hit it big, and everyone pretty much knew what they were in for when they signed up.  If you didn't want to take the time to learn how to trade successfully, or simply didn't believe it was possible to do so, than WSB provided an alternative - gamble.   And no judgement on that - a casino is fine, as long as you know you are walking into a casino.

And then came **GME**.  One of their members, DeepFuckingValue discovered a stock with a flaw - it was over-shorted.  Turned out, he was right.  It was.  There is no doubt that what happened next was historic - Retail traders came together as a group, and actually had a lasting impact on the market.   

*This is rare.*  

While retail traders like to believe they have the power to move markets, they don't.  Institutions move the market, retail traders simply do not have buying power to have a lasting impact on the price action of any one stock.   But in this case, they did. 

Because of that phenomenon WSB changed.  They began to believe they could continue to move the markets.  And along came **AMC**.  While the WSB crowd certainly helped push **AMC** into a short-squeeze, this time Institutions joined in, which was reflected in the volume of the stock.  Still, this only added to the allure of the subreddit, with people beginning to believe they had the power to impact the price of a stock through the sheer force of collective action.

Suddenly, WSB went from people in a casino, to a place filled with wannabe social warriors, believing they were screwing over hedge funds by holding onto their shares (*Diamond hands!*).  Post after post began to emerge, each one touting that they found the next **GME** or **AMC**.  And, if we are being honest, some of the DD written there would rival that of any high paid analyst.  I admit, some of those posts are impressive.

Soon though, anytime a low float/high short stock would pop with strong volume, WSB was taking credit.  Retail traders, who desperately want to believe they have more power than they do, were quick to support this notion.  Lists of the *most mentioned* tickers on WSB would be circulate around each day.  Each stock on the list would have extensive write-ups dedicated to exactly why and when it would "squeeze" or better yet, "gamma squeeze", or even better yet, "an infinity squeeze!".   Inevitably, some of them did.  I say this is inevitable because if any of you were to compile a list of the top 20 low float-high short stocks, chances are at least one of them will experience a jump on any given day.  So when **CLOV** (an example) surged up - WSB was right there saying they knew it all along, and it was the result of their members buying up shares .  As for the other 19 stocks on the list that didn't move or went down?  Well, WSB's roots as a gambling sub never went away, so the losses on those other tickers are celebrated.   You just lost $75,000 on **IRNT**? "This is the way".  

Here's the truth though - there is no correlation between the top mentioned stocks on WSB and their likelihood of going up on any given day.  

In fact, brokers have stated that roughly 98% of those playing the Meme stocks have *lost* money (they said this on financial news shows), and a large number of accounts have been wiped out.  There is no reason not to believe this is true - as those brokers actually have more of an incentive to lie about that number.  The more people believe they can get rich playing Meme stocks, the more people sign up to trade.

However, the rule still applies, even if they don't believe, even if the mythology of WSB that circulates among traders doesn't support it - ***Retail traders DO NOT move markets, they do not have a lasting impact on price action, Institutions do.***  

This fact doesn't stop people from constantly saying, "Oh, **LCID** went up because everyone at WSB decided to target it."   No, sorry - that is not why.  Spend 10 minutes in that sub and you will quickly realize they couldn't coordinate the mass purchasing of anything.  **GME** and perhaps **AMC** was a black-swan event, where not only did the members of that subreddit act in unison, but thousands of other retail traders around the world joined in.  

But now?  They simply do not have the organization or focus to pull that off again.  Nor do they have the liquidity - most of them are broke.  You can only spend some much time gambling in a casino before you have liquidated every last dime and you consider selling yourself down at the docks for a few shares of **PROG**.  

I once argued with their moderator - telling him that they were ruining lives, encouraging people not only to gamble, but to not even take profits on the low chance that they actually make money.  The response?  *People know what they are getting into and should know better than to take advice from a bunch of Apes.*  

Perhaps.  But let's not forget - these "people" are usually desperate.  They have seen in the news examples of people that became millionaires overnight all while "sticking it to the Institutions", and then look around at their debt filled life and want a way out.  So they believe.  Can you blame them?  Again, it is a grey area.  Still, I have spoken to enough of these people that have lost everything to know that they truly did believe in what they were reading.  They believed that the DD looked so convincing, and they thought they were doing the right thing.  Turns out - they weren't.

So let's keep them in the context that they are - if you want to just gamble, then go there.  But do not kid yourself that they are traders, no matter how much DD you read - they are not.  If you are ok with losing money, but getting cheered on as you do - that is the sub for you.   

Here - we are about actually making money - *consistently*.  We aren't trying to *beat* the Institutions, just the opposite, we are *mimicking* them.  Those trends are you friend.  

Our job as retail traders is not to "move" the market or impact the price, our job as retail traders is to analyze the market and *follow* the price.

So if you have come here from WSB - welcome.  Welcome to Real Trading.  Please leave your "stonks" and "tendies" at the door. There are no Apes here, your wife doesn't have a boyfriend and we don't eat at Wendy's.  We teach people how to make a living off the market without rocket emojis.  

Trust me - *This Is The Real Way.*

Best, H.S.
