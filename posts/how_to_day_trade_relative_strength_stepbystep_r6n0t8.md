I recorded this video with examples of how we traded relative strength during the rally early in the day and as I was recording the conditions reversed so I showed you how members were taking bearish trades. Today's price action illustrates the advantages of trading relative strength and weakness. 

I do use Option Stalker in the video because the searches and indicators are designed for trading relative strength and weakness. If you feel this is "shilling" please don't watch the video.
