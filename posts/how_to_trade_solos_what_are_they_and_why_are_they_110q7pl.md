I just completed an article and I thought I would share it with you. "Solos" can really mess you up mentally and financially. Here's what they are, how to identify them and how to trade them.

"Solos" are single long candles (typically engulfing candles) that often shake traders out of a position. They are critically important to identify and we see them at relative highs and relative lows. We can also see them around trendlines, but I will cover that in a future article. They are common during a strong trend and particularly after a big move within a strong trend and in the direction of the trend.

Let's focus on the short side knowing that the same concept applies on the long side. Big moves down will eventually attract buyers. Sellers will be less aggressive at those lower levels and shorts will be a little more anxious to lock in gains. The candles start to compress and the bodies become tiny. This is a classic sign that we might see a green "Solo". These candles look like the "real deal" and they are long.

As long as we only see one candle (hence the term solo), we have to patiently wait to see what happens next. If we see two stacked green candles consecutively, it is a sign of support and we need to prepare to take gains on shorts. This is more than a short covering bounce and buyers are interested. How the @#$% do we know that? If sellers were aggressive, there would be offers layered higher and you would never stack two "greens" consecutively. If you have a "Solo" followed by a doji and then you get another green candle, you also need to take gains on shorts. Buyers are aggressive enough to lift the "ask". It is a sign that sellers are not that aggressive and that buyers are. They key to a green solo in a strong down trend is that it will be hammered down in the next 3-5 bars (or less).

The novice trader assumes that all bullish engulfing candles at a relative low are a sign of a trend reversal. They panic out of their shorts because they just "lost" a nice chunk of their gains on that "stupid green candle". The "seasoned novice" knows better than to get long. They know to wait for confirmation so  they avoid the pending bull trap. The novice trader makes a classic error. They start believing that this green candle is the start of a trend reversal and they get long. "Buy low and sell high. I am going to make a killing when this market recovers." In a matter of 2-3 bars, that "Solo" gets hammered down like a nail through balsa wood. The novice trader gets their head handed to them. As the down trend resumes with a vengeance they puke their long position along with every other novice and the next leg lower accelerates. The "seasoned novice" complains that they need to "be more patient" and that they need to "let their trades run". **WRONG!** Many of these will lead to reversals. They need to be more proficient at recognizing trend strength. They got completely whipsawed out of a great short position and they left a ton of money on the table.

So how do we know? The price action heading into the "Solo" is critical. If the selling has been steady with stacked red candles like the ones in the chart above, sellers are aggressive. We need to look for all of the signs I've been teaching you with regards to trend strength. In the chart above, notice how the retracements are minor and the volume is good. When we have a strong trend lower, put your "big boy" pants on and welcome these "Solos". They will confirm that you are on the right side and they will lead to the next leg lower. Often, you won't get that next move lower until you see a "Solo". As long as it is only one candle, you can add to shorts when that long green candle is quickly hammered down in the next few bars. Dip buyers are going to get crushed and bail. Profit takers who covered their shorts on that "Solo" are going to regret getting out and they are going to re-establish short positions. Both of these actions are bearish and you can rejoice knowing that you recognized the trend strength and that you stayed the course. This is next level stuff and when you hit this point you are on your way to becoming a good trader.

If the trend strength has featured mixed overlapping candles on light volume, we should expect that an engulfing candle is **NOT** a "Solo". It is imperative that you know the characteristics of a strong trend and a weak trend. In the example below we have a weak rally. That "Bearish Engulfing" candle off of the high of the day is **NOT** likely to be a "Solo". It is likely warning us of a trend reversal and a move down.

I hope this lesson helps you.
