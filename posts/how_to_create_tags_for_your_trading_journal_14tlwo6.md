Keeping an ongoing trading journal is essential.  I have always said that if you were to spend money on only one thing, it should be on getting online journal (I use TraderSync, but that is personal preference).  Could you make your own? Probably - but I doubt it would give you all the tools that a preset journal already has built-in.

Obviously your journal keeps track of your win-rate, profit factor, total number of trades, etc. which are key numbers that you should be plugging into your trading business plan, like this:

**Business Plan Example:**

Goal: $15,000 a month in profit, $180,000 total profit per year

Annual Hard Costs (Internet, Subscriptions, Software, etc.): $5,500 per year

Win-Rate (averaged over 1,000 trades): 70%

Average Profit Per Winning Trade: $100

Average Loss Per Losing Trade: $60

Average number of Trades Per Day: 10

Expected Daily Profit: $520

Expected Annual Profit (based on 252 Trading Days): $131,040

Based on a plan like this you would realize that you need to either increase the number of trades per day, decrease the average loss, increase the average win, or increase your win-rate.  Your stats and your goal in this case would not align and need to be addressed. 

This is where your journal comes in once again.  If you have been properly labelling your trades you would be able to identify the areas you are more successful and thus, take more of those set-ups or where you need to improve (or avoid).

Everyone has different methods on how they "tag" their trades, but to help those who are struggling to come up with a good system, I have created a taxonomy that you can implement:

**Method of Classifying Trades**

Let's start with the "Mistakes" because fuck-ups are more fun.  Any good method of categorization starts "top-down".  First we need to define, "Mistake".  For the purposes here I will use a very simple definition - a *mistake* is something that was in your control and had a negative impact on the result.  So if news hit that suddenly tanks a stock you had a long position on, that would be out of your control and not a, *mistake*.  However, if you knew news was going to be released on the stock and traded it anyway, that would be a *mistake*. 

There are **three** meta-level mistakes:

**Trade** 

**Entry**

**Exit**

*Mistake - Trade:* You should never have taken this trade.

*Mistake - Entry:*  The trade was fine, but you screwed up the entry.

*Mistake - Exit:* The trade was fine, but you screwed up the exit.

Now each of these would have sub-categories, these are some, but you can add others.  I would just caution against having too many tags as you want to be able to look at your trades by each category and would need enough of a sample for it to be meaningful.  You would also use a combination of various tags:

**Mistake - Trade**

*Mistake - Trade - Against The Market*

*Mistake - Trade - Countertrend*

*Mistake - Trade - Gambling*

*Mistake - Trade - Low Probability Trading Environment* 

*Mistake - Trade - Low Probability Trade (this one could have it's own sub-categories as well)*

*Mistake - Trade - Not Confirmed* 

*Mistake - Trade - No Relative Strength/Weakness*

*Mistake - Trade - Ignorance (i.e. you took a trade you did not understand)*

*Mistake - Trade - I was an idiot and I am not sure why*

*Mistake - Trade - Other*

**Mistake - Entry/Exit**

*Mistake - Entry - Did Not Wait for Pullback*

*Mistake - Entry - Chased*

*Mistake - Exit - Held Loser too Long*

*Mistake - Exit - Cut Winner Short Should Have Held*

*Mistake - Exit - Cut Winner Short Should Have Added*

*Mistake - Exit - Averaged Down*

*Mistake - Exit - Ignorance (i.e. you screwed up exiting a spread because you had no idea what you were doing)*

It is also important to include any emotion that factored into your decision.  You should have set "emotion" tags that you can add to any trade, such as;

**Fear**

**Greed**

**Hope**

**FOMO**

Sometimes the fuck-up is so complete that your tags might look like this:

*Mistake - Trade - Gambling, Mistake - Entry - Chased, Mistake - Exit - Held Loser too Long,* **FOMO, Greed, Fear**

Basically you saw a stock jump up in price so you quickly took the trade (FOMO and Greed led to Gambling) and then you chased the price up until you got filled, it turned against you but you stayed in way too long and got your ass kicked.

**Set-Ups**

A good online journal will have a place for you to put your "mistakes" and another place for you to enter the set-up of the trade.

**You might first want to note what the market conditions were at the time of the trade:**

*High Probability Trading Environment* 

*Low Probability Trading Environment* 

*Bullish Trend Day*

*Bearish Trend Day*

*Low Range Chop*

*High Range Chop*

**Here are the basic top-level set-ups:**

*Relative Strength* 

*Relative Weakness*

*Sector Strength*

*Sector Weakness*

*Strong Daily Chart*

*Weak Daily Chart*

*Good Relative Volume*

*With Market*

*Against Market (this isn't always a mistake)*

*Hedge Trade*

*Lotto Trade*

*SPY/QQQ Trade*

*Afterhours*

*Unusual Option Activity*

**And some more detailed set-ups (Support/Resistance is assumed to be daily) :**

*Break of Compression - Daily*

*Break of Compression - Intraday*

*Break of Trendline Resistance (you can put an "A" next to this if it was an Algo line)*

*Break of Trendline Support (you can put an "A" next to this if it was an Algo line)*

*Break of Horizontal Resistance* 

*Break of VWAP or AVWAP*

*Break of SMA(s)*

*Momentum with Catalyst (e.g. a news event)*

*Momentum with no Catalyst*  

*Bounce off Support*

*Rejected at Resistance* 

*In the Gap*

**You should also enter the type of trade:**

*Straight* *Calls*

*Straight Puts*

*CDS*

*PDS*

*CCS*

*PCS*

*WATM*

*Earnings Time Spread*

*OTM PCS*

*Bracketed Butterfly*

*Day Trade*

*Swing Trade*

*Day trade turned into Swing Trade*

*Scalp*

You can also include you mood for that day (which is different from the temporary emotion you felt regarding a specific trade):

**Happy**

**Anxious**

**Depressed**

**Desperate** 

**Angry**

**On Tilt**

**Exhausted** 

**Irritable** 

**Excited**

**Annoyed**

So a full trade might look like this:

*High Probability Trading Environment, Bullish Trend Day, Relative Strength , Sector Strength, Strong Daily Chart, Good Relative Volume, With Market, Break of Compression - Daily, Straight* *Calls, Swing Trade, Excited*

This way after many months of trading you will have enough cases to be able to look at all the trades you made that included *Straight Calls* with *Relative Strength* to see what your win-rate is on just those two set-ups. Then you can compare for when it was a *High Probability* day or a *Low Probability* day.  

Once you master tagging your trades you will be able to look at countless combinations to find your strengths and weaknesses.  A good online journal will also be able to tell you what scenarios you excel in and which ones need work.

Clearly there are a lot more categories you can add to this, but hopefully by now you get the general idea.  

This is a long overdue post given how important the subject matter is to your trading education (and yes, it will go in the Wiki). 

Best, H.S.
