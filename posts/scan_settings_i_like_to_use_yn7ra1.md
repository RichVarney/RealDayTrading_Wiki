I’ve been getting some DMs about what scanner I use to find my picks. For disclosure, my main scanner is Option Stalker from [oneoption.com](http://oneoption.com/) and my secondary scanner is [Trade Ideas](http://trade-ideas.com). Hari has a [review on TI](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/wjno3v/tradeideas_a_review_and_other_recommendations/) .

The 1OP scanner is literally built for our strategy.  I’ve been playing around with TI because it's also very powerful yet I'm not  certain that the additional cost is worth it.  Diminishing returns and such.  It also takes a lot of work to get it dialed in to our strategy.

I’m writing this out because ‘what scanner do you use’ is the  wrong question to ask. The right question is ‘what filters do you use’ or ‘what do you scan for and why or when’, regardless of the platform. Any scanning/screening platform should be able to search for many or all of these filters:

**BASIC FILTERS I LIKE** (I’ll modify these once in a while, but nothing gets scanned that doesn’t fit these):

\-Price per share: $5+

\-Float: at least 50M

\-Average Daily Volume: at least 1.5M

\-Average True Range: at least $1.5

\-Relative Volume: at least 1.5x.

**THE SCANS I USE**  with the above filters (these are **always** up on my screen):

1. 52Wk/AT high/low scans
2. NHOD and NLOD on volume
3. D1 compression breakout, with 4 daily candles minimum compression (experimental)
4. D1 compression breakdown, with 4 daily candles minimum compression (experimental).
5. Strong D1 with all SMAs in order (all above filters + sustained RS vs SPY or Sector + above VWAP +3+ green candles in a row). SMA 200<100<50<current price
6. Weak D1 SMAs in order (Strong D1 flipped)
7. Consistent Green Candles on increasing volume (3+ candles with increasing volume)
8. Consistent Red Candles on increasing volume (3+  candles with increasing volume)
9. Royal Flush green (1OP scan)
10. Royal Flush red (1OP scan)

I also have a few others on 1OP that I check regularly, but those are my go-to daily scans.

That’s it. Then I quickly type in all of my results into a ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ watchlist and flip through them, eyeballing for nice patterns on the D1. Then I delete those D1s that don’t look good. If one doesn’t ‘yet’ look good but would at a certain level, I place an alert.

From the resulting list I then go into the 5M and do the same, and I’m left with a nice list of potentials.

I do this a few times a session to keep the list updated as sectors rotate in and out.

Hopefully my scanner settings give you an idea or two. If it can’t be implemented in your scanner, maybe a variation of the above would work. What’s important is that we understand why we scan for what we do and then see if our tools can give us some nice picks. Then integrate it into your workflow to blast through charts intraday.
