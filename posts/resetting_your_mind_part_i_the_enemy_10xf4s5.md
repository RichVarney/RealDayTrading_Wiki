By now you should know that "mindset" is 90% of trading.  If you don't then you haven't read the Wiki and/or are new here.  If you are either of those, you need to stop what you are doing and go read the damn Wiki (i.e., RTDW).

There certainly is not anything new about this claim, and most professional traders will tell you the same thing.  While the arbitrary number of 90% may vary, the overall point will not - **Mindset is more important than method.**

In fact, without the right mindset chances are you are using a shitty method to trade.  We all know who they are, some are just beginners, others have been tainted by WSB, and some are just a pure gamblers at heart.  How do you know if you fall into this category? Well if you are trying to catch those low-float, high short gappers each morning, you need to look no further - because it's you.  

Granted there are actually only a staggeringly few number of methods that consistently produce profit trading.  

Unfortunately, as I, and many others have seen time and time again, a trader can know everything there is to know about those methods, and still lose money.  Why? Mindset. 

The Wiki (and this sub) preaches the importance of mindset, and the testimonials of those that have successfully transitioned to becoming full-time traders attest to how essential it is to get your head screwed on right - but for many, the mental art of trading remains an elusive skill to grasp.  

So, I have decided to do a series of posts, each one of them covering a particular mindset issue that one needs to deal with in order to become a successful trader.  

We will start off with a relatively basic one. A recent post I made showed me just how prevalent this  flawed way of thinking has become amongst many of you.  

The other day I posted an [Institutional Trade Idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/10wf79f/institutional_trade_idea/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I received what looked to be an interesting trade suggestion from JPM and wanted to share it with the larger group. In doing so it seems some people thought I was saying that I "worked for JPM".  It appears the issue was with the phrase "having a desk".  While most experienced traders know that the term, "Having a Desk" at an Institution like JPM (or GS, etc.) simply means having a large trading account with their bank, most others thought it meant I actually had a desk working at their office as an employee.  *Having a Desk* means that you, the client, are assigned a number of their *Trading Advisors* to service you.  In this sense, JPM is no different than Ameritrade or Robinhood, just with a lot more customer service, better rates and access to a ton of information.  I trade various accounts.  With TD Ameritrade (and through their ThinkorSwim platform) I have my Long-Term Positions, Regular Day-Trading and Challenge accounts.  However, I use JPM to trade a far larger account (over $5 million).   

Due to that confusion some people thought I went to work for, "the Enemy".  

**The...Enemy.** 

This belief is deeply engrained into many of you.  In fact, the entire sub, WallStreetBets, is predicated on the notion that is "Us vs. The Hedgies", where the ultimate goal is to bring about the ruin of those dastardly hedge funds. This shared belief allowed members to feel like they were part of some larger, noble, mission.  They were/are the warriors against those that would do us harm.  While they will credit themselves for stocks like **GME** and **AMC**, they do not seem to realize the crucial flaw in their thinking.  Billions of dollars were made through the buying and selling of those "meme" stocks. Billions.  And other than a few anecdotal examples of some random people that made $1 or $2 million,  the rest of the money went to the very funds they were trying to break down.

Think of the market as a giant corporation.  If it were, we would be the equivalent of the employees in the mailroom. It should come as no surprise that the decisions the board of that corporation makes have nothing to do with the grunts down in the mailroom.  

**They make decisions to benefit** ***them*** **not to screw** ***us*****.**  

Do some of those decisions wind up screwing us anyway? Of course - but trust me when I say that they quite simply do not care.  

I partially covered this type of thinking in the post, [The Insidious Power of Wealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/tc2x94/the_insidious_power_of_wealth/) but it deserves more attention.

The entire idea that we matter one way or another is a fantasy constructed that serves two purposes:

1) **Absolves us of blame**. It wasn't your shitty trading, it was the *market*!  

2) **Ego.** Nobody wants to think they don't matter. It is far easier to think that not only do you matter, but you are so important that those "in charge" are specifically out to get **you**.

The problem is when one indulges in this fantasy you miss the real unfairness of it all.  

*The rules are constructed to benefit those with wealth, and it is those rules that are inherently unfair.*  

They have access to information and services you don't, pay less taxes than you do, and already have the correct mindset built-in.

Also consider that if you were in their position you would most likely act exactly as they do, which is out of self-interest.

As I have pointed out before - being someone that came from poverty, I also had a certain view of "wealth" and those that had it. It was only when I was able to travel in those same circles that I began to see that there is no conspiracy, no evil plot to cause harm - there is just a complete and total disinterest in anyone but themselves.  An absolute disconnect from reality if you will. In their minds there are those that have wealth and there is everyone else. If you fall in the "everyone else" group they expect you to act against your own interest and lose money.   By and large, they are correct in this regard.

So why is this mindset a problem?  Who cares if you see the Institutions as evil? 

Simple - because as traders your job is to *follow the money*.  We aren't trying to "beat" the "hedgies", we want to emulate them.  In the long haul, when we counter-trend trade, we lose.  If the Institutions are suddenly buying up **MSFT**, which we can see through *Relative Strength* as **MSFT** goes up while the market does not - we want to also *buy* ***MSFT***.  

However, that is difficult to do if we constantly see Institutions as an enemy that we have to fight.  

Does this mean that their Algos aren't programmed to take advantage of retail trading patterns? Of course they are!  Retail isn't that hard to figure out.  They buy the dip and sell the surge. Most use basic *Technical Analysis.* The Algos know this and take full advantage of retail driving a price up or down.  However, reframe that idea for a moment - the Algos are taking advantage of bad trading habits, which also means they reward correct trading methods.  

In other words, if you are the idiot that thought it was a good idea to short **NVDA** at $200, then you *should* be losing your money right now - because that is a *terrible* way to trade.  However, if you are the kind of trader that went long on **NVDA** at $200, you absolute *should* be making money - because that is the *correct* way to trade. 

The trader going long **NVDA** at $200 wasn't trying to outsmart the market, they weren't trying to "beat the funds", they were simply going with the Institutional trend.

Trust me, I get it. It is hard not to look around at your life and not think that you are intentionally being fucked over.  

The reality is, yes, you *are* being fucked over, but not intentionally.  

You are being fucked over simply because nobody cares.  

You got sick and now are under a pile of debt from health-related bills? They don't care.  Why? Because the health system works just fine for them.  

You're paying close to 40% in taxes? They don't care. Why? Because they never pay more than 10% (full disclosure - neither do I), you should just get yourself a better accountant.  What's that? That cost money you don't have? Weird. Well, I am sure you'll figure it out.  

You lost everything in the market? Well, you should just get yourself a better financial consultant.  What's that? You're telling me that *also* cost money you don't have? Weird. Well, I am sure you'll just make more.  

Your reality is not theirs, and they don't care to know anything more than that.  Besides - they give to charity, that should cover it, right? 

Imagine for one moment that you work for one of these "Institutions" and you have been put in charge of a $500 million fund.  Your job is simple - By the end of the year there better be at least $525 million in that fund or you are fired.  That's it - that's your job - make 5%.  Do you really care if retail traders are Short **SPY** or taking a Put Debit Spread on **CAT**?  No.  You care about that 1.5 Billion order that was placed today on 4050 E-Mini Puts, because *that* moved the market.  You care if the Treasury rate is over 4.5% for the 2yr and how close that gets you to your goal.  

And you will use every resource at your disposal to hit that goal.  Your competition is other $500 million funds, not retail traders - because you just have to perform better than they do. Otherwise you will need to explain to your boss why your fund is at $530 million and the one over at Goldman Sachs is at $570 million.  **That is what you care about.**  And that is just the person managing that money.  The people that actually put that money into the fund?? They don't even care about the fund-manager, just as long as they do their job. 

Now before you all get on your high-horse to judge these people, ask yourself a question - When was the last time you cared about someone that is homeless?  When is the last time you spent time with a person in total poverty? Fought for better conditions for them? Worked in a soup kitchen? 

Because just as those greedy wealthy bastards are to you, you are to those people sleeping on the street. And just like you step over them pretending they aren't there, the wealthy step over you. 

Is it shitty all around? Yeah. But this is one of the many reasons I hate people.  Certainly not the only reason, but definitely one of them.

Anyway - this is the first mindset issue to extradite yourself away from - the only enemy here is yourself.  Nobody is out to get you. But they aren't going to help you either.  Instead, they leave behind a roadmap in the charts, that map tells you what they are doing and where they are going.  Stop hating them and starting following the map instead.

Best, H.S.
