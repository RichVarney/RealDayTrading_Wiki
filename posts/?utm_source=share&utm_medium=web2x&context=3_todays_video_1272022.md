Here is today's video.  In it you will see why I took the AAPL and MSFT trades last night.  I show you exactly how they are perfectly in line with everything we teach here, and the trades were confirmed before acting.  

Now I will admit that my emotional response to the market fuckery did prompt me to take larger than usual position (which paid off), and that was a mistake.  However, the *reasons* for the trades were absolutely in line with the analysis.
