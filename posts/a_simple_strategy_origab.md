From the poll this morning it seems the number one issue is the lack of a clear strategy, so I am going to give you one to try - 

Tomorrow - Do not take any trades in the first 45 minutes.  None.  I don't care how good it looks.  What you need to be doing is the following:

1) Watching the market - if we open down, are there signs of a reversal, is SPY still probing for support?  If we open up, is the market hitting resistance here?  Get a sense of whether it will be a Bullish, Bearish or Neutral day.

2) Watch which stocks are *Relatively Strong*, and by this I don't just mean the stocks that opened higher if the market is down.  If you do not have TC2000 or OptionStalker, go to [Finviz.com](https://Finviz.com) and give a look at their S&P Red/Green graphic - click on it, and look which stocks are standing out - is everything in AAPL's sector up .5% but AAPL is up 1.3%?  Get a list of the strongest stocks.  Now starting looking at their charts on a 5 minute basis with SPY mapped against the chart.    Note the stocks you look for do not *have* to be in the S&P 500, just make sure they aren't low float gappers, or any stock under $10.

3) Notice the stocks that do not go down on the 5-min basis when SPY does down.  Notice the ones that go up a lot on just the slightest bullish 5-min candle on SPY.   Check their daily charts, make sure they are bullish and without clear resistance close by (e.g. you don't want a stock that has the 200 SMA sitting 15 cents above the current price).  Make sure the stocks have good volume as well.

At this point, around 45 min into the day, you should have at least 3-5 good stocks that are relatively strong, with good volume, no resistance nearby and bullish daily charts.  

4)  Draw your downward trendline on SPY and wait for an indication that SPY is going higher.  If SPY is very bullish then you do not need to wait.  If SPY drops you will still be protected by the Relative Strength.

5) The moment SPY breaches that downward trendline to the upside, go long on the stocks in your list, as long as they have maintained their Relative Strength.  Take profits when it looks like they are no longer strong than SPY.

This should give you at least 5 really good trades throughout the day with very high probabilities for success.
