A couple of days ago I asked a member to send me their trade logs for the last two weeks. I wanted to see what they were missing. After reviewing a few of their trades, I decided to look at all 18 of them. It took me a couple of hours to conduct the analysis because I had to go back in time and recreate the set-up. I had the exact time stamp for the entry, the date, the symbol and the direction. What did the SPY look like D1? What did the SPY look like M5 at that exact moment? What did the stock look like D1? What did the stock look like M5 at that exact moment? Great trades are like a lock, all of the tumblers have to line up for the door to open. Not some of them... all of them.

Yesterday I recorded a video and I reviewed all 18 trades one-by-one. This video is almost two hours long. I did it because I believe it will help a lot of you. This is the process you have to go through each day. Trade log analysis will reinforce what you are doing right and it will help you identify what you are doing wrong so that you can avoid those mistakes in the future. If you leave out this critical step, you will be muddling around for years and you won't make it. 

This is a detailed look at how we trade the system. Many of you say you will do anything to become a successful trader. Really? This is your chance to prove it. Are you willing to put in a couple of hours to learn this?

The audio isn't perfect, but an aspiring trader would not let that stand in their way! Please leave your comments.
