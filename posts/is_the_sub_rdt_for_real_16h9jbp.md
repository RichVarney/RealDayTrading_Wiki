This is a public statement in response to a post that was made on the large daytrading subreddit:

&#x200B;

>I (kind of) like their analysis and their RS/RW methodology. However, the sub seems too nice to be true - unlike, most other trading subs. It might be because it is heavily mod'ed and I'm fine with that.  
>  
>I'm looking to join a directional trading chat-room and their service seems nice however there have been some negative comments as well on [r/Daytrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/) regarding that sub.  
>  
>Pete, Hari, Dave seem like nice folks but what has been your experience with them?  
>  
>thanks in advance for your comments  
>  
>PS: I can understand it to be marketing sub for their subscription chat/software but nevertheless if the value is good, I'm willing to pay up (I'm doing well on options vol strategies overall and wanted to step up my directional trading skills). I'm currently looking for a place to discuss day/swing trade ideas.

&#x200B;

Although most of these questions are answered in the Wiki, I'll re-iterate them once again.

&#x200B;

**"The sub seems too nice to be true, unlike most other trading subs."**

I actually disagree that we're too nice to be true. If anything, we are a lot harsher than other subreddits. If somebody comes here to say they want to trade /MES using 1 minute charts, they will be promptly asked to read our Wiki material or be banned.

We also do not entertain general "trading tips" posts in here by unvetted individuals, which you will find the other trading subs littered with.

&#x200B;

**"\[...\] there have been some negative comments as well on** [**r/Daytrading**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/) **regarding that sub."**

There will always be negative comments regarding anything in the public. Hari himself used to received death threats for his work in Hollywood script analysis, way before he discovered daytrading. None of this is new. I also won't air out dirty laundry here but know that we have dealt with some very shady individuals in the past; just know that there are always two sides to a story.

&#x200B;

**"Pete, Hari, Dave seem like nice folks but what has been your experience with them?"**

u/HSeldon2020 , who calls himself a misanthrope, would disagree that he is a nice person. DaveW (u/onewyse) also does not tolerate asking dumb questions that have been answered many times. Pete (u/OptionStalker), despite being in the industry since most of us were born, is one of the nicest people in the space, though he will also be quick to remind you that this is a cutthroat industry and you'll have to make sacrifices to make this happen.

But one thing they all have in common -- THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO LOSE MONEY.  They want to see every one of you SUCCEED. Hari most of all, is TAKING RESPONSIBILITY for the content he wrote in the Wiki by using the Wiki to trade every single day.

It is so easy for people on other forums to give trading advice when they don't actually have to put some money where their mouth is, and show their pupils in real time.

This is why Hari posts his trades, live. To prove that this works.

&#x200B;

**"I can understand it to be marketing sub for their subscription chat/software"**

This is actually not true. Full disclaimer: I am a member and moderator for the OneOption chat room. Our 3 other Senior Moderators, u/Ajoynt551 , u/achinfatt and u/Reeks_of_Theon (the most active moderator on this subreddit and especially the Live Chat), are not OneOption members, nor do they have any interest in joining.

OneOption is a great community. Many members enjoy the mature, business like atmosphere of the chat room being led by Hari. It truly is a unique space. It is heavily moderated (mostly by Hari), and some people feel that the atmosphere is oppressive. Those people are entitled to their opinions, but many, many more subscribers appreciate the no nonsense environment that is OneOption.

Pete brings his decades of experience to the chat room everyday when he is not working on improving his scanners. Most of the members agree that his market commentary (the intraday price action of SPY) is invaluable.

DaveW actually runs his own chat room (Right Line), but he also posts in the OneOption room and shares his trades with the community.

If you are not profitable, if you don't yet know if trading is right for you, if you can't commit almost every minute of your free time to learning how to trade, if $1500/year is something you actually have to budget for, WE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM JOINING ONEOPTION. This is the public statement from RealDayTrading.

Instead, we encourage you to save your money, only spend it on the bare minimum (market data if you're an IB customer, maybe TraderSync if you can spare the sub fee and using Excel is too tedious.) while you're learning.

&#x200B;

**"I'm currently looking for a place to discuss day/swing trade ideas."**

RealDayTrading is only appropriate for people who are willing to surrender, to drop their ego, to come to the plate with an open mind and the commitment to learn the Wiki and to do the 10-steps and become an actual consistently profitable trader. If this describes you, then you are welcomed at RealDayTrading.

If you just wanted a place to discuss some trade ideas that has nothing to do with the curriculum, perhaps you better stick to the other trading subreddit.

Edit:

I received a comment suggesting that there is a "push" toward OneOption at this sub, and that there is a a financial relationship between Hari, RDT, Pete (u/OptionStalker), and OneOption.

 I disagree that the sub pushes people to those services. The purpose of this post is to clarify that this is not the case.

Our public stances are-

You do not need OneOption.

You can be profitable without OneOption.

However, OneOption is a nice place for the reasons I mentioned in the post.

With regards to financial incentive-

Pete has a financial interest in OneOption as it is his company, and he makes it abundantly clear.

Hari has no financial ties to OneOption. If he did, it would not make sense for him to post his trades in real time on this subreddit (free) and Twitter (free).

Hari uses OSP (OneOption's "Option Stalker Pro" program for scanning and charting). But he could very well trade without OSP if he so chooses. 

Hari is, however, the leader of the OneOption chat room. This is done without any financial incentive.
