We have focused a lot here on mindset.  You can have all the trading knowledge and skill in the world, but with the wrong mindset you won't reach consistent success. 

Since the mindset required is in many ways the opposite of the one many of us live with every day, changing the way we think becomes one of the most difficult things a trader can do in their journey towards profitability.

But as we all know, working on mindset isn't all *internal* \- there are many *external* factors each of us have to deal with on a daily basis.  Sometimes, these *external* issues can severely impact our psychological well-being, which of course also impacts our, trading.

I am primarily referring to *family, friends, co-workers,* and *acquaintances.*

It is one thing to tell someone you are a successful trader, as it is hard to argue with someone that is currently living off the proceeds of their profession.  Although you will invariably get someone who says, 

*"Yeah, but what happens if the market crashes?"*  

The response to that is simply - *"It will suck for long-term investors, but I will be just fine - in fact one of the many benefits of short-term trading is being able to trade in both bull and bear markets, as well as being protected against any type of crash."*

But most of you aren't *yet* successful full-time traders, so instead you most likely hear some of the following:

*"Have you made money yet?"*

*"That's the same as gambling, you'll never be able to make a living that way"*

*"It's all rigged - you don't stand a chance"*

*"Just don't lose everything because at some point you'll need to get a real job"*

Or you will get some form of frustrating commiseration, like:

*"Yeah, I do some trading also  - I like to buy cheap penny stocks...this one time....blah blah.."*

*"I know someone that does this, and she says....blah blah"*

*"Just buy Apple....there, I did your trading for you, you're done."*

Some of you will face outright hostility, that might sound like this:

*"How are we suppose to live off that?  We don't have the luxury for you to screw around and lose our savings!"*

*"That is ridiculous - you can't beat the market, don't like 95% fail?"*

*"So basically you're saying you're unemployed and have no intention of getting a real job?"*

Depending on the company you keep, some of these comments may be laced with quite a bit of profanity. 

It gets to the point where you just don't want to tell anyone what you are doing, as it is too emotionally draining to defend yourself everyday.  I am sure it also gets to your psyche, making you doubt your choice, because - what if they are right?

So what can you do?

The first thing, if you have one, you need to focus on your partner, spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.  I am lucky enough to have a partner that not only understood what I was trying to do in the beginning, but took it upon herself to learn it as well (she is now a really good trader), but I get that not everyone has that.   

What you need to do, first with your partner, and then with everyone else is the following:

**Viability:** One of the biggest concerns people have is that trading for a living is simply not *viable*.  So you to show them that it is possible.  You can point them to the $30K challenge here, or even show them the recent string of 53 straight profitable trades.  They need to know that it *can* be done.  Every thing here is shown with complete transparency for that reason - whether it is the trading journal I made public, or that every trade is posted live.  You will not find some photoshopped pictures of account balances in this sub - only verifiable winning trades are used.  It also isn't just me, there are several pros here that you can use as examples that the system *isn't rigged.*  They need to realize this is an actual career, and not some scam or pipe dream.  And if all else fails - *show them*.  Let them follow the Twitter account, or watch the live trades as they happen for one day.

**Strategy:** You also need to point out that you are going about this with a clear head, rational expectations and with a plan.  Much like a business, you should outline your strategy of getting to profitability.  In the post on the 10 Steps to Getting Started I outline a multi-year step-by-step guide, which should help you in building your own plan.  People need to know that you aren't just throwing money at some "get rich quick" method you watched on YouTube, but rather you are approaching this as an actual *career*.  That includes studying material, resources, practice, and implementation.  An actual timeline is usually most-helpful in this regard.

**Reverse-It:** If all else fails - reverse it. Here is what most people do, and chances are what you may have done yourself - Go to college for four years and then get a job.  Maybe go from job to job for a bit, until you finally settle on a company and begin to work your way up.  After five to ten years of busting your ass, perhaps you finally get promoted to V.P. or Director or some other position that your younger self would kick your ass for taking.  And there you sit in a cubicle, or a small office, making just enough to stay in debt and barely pay off the bills - no real savings, and if you lost that job you would be screwed.  All for what?  So the moment the company decides it is time for cutbacks you are out the door? At least what you are doing doesn't require another decade of getting your life sucked out of you all to get discarded in the end.  What you are doing can lead to real financial independence, actual freedom.  Isn't that worth it?

And if they *still* don't get it after that - *fuck'em*.  Seriously, *fuck'em*.  You don't need that kind of negatively in your life, and you certainly do not need that lack of support.  You can't let it impact you, because guess what? *They* have no exit plan.  Chances are they hate their job, but they aren't doing anything about it.  You're trying to do something to better your life, so don't let those who aren't bring you down.

The larger mission of this sub is to change the conversation around *short-term* trading, to make it the respectable and viable career choice it should be, and when we are successful (because we *will be*), the comments people will hear in the future will be much different.

Best, H.S.
