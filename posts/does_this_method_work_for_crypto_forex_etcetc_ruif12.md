I get this question a lot - and the short answer is - Yes.

The method used here, at its' core is a process of indexing a stocks strength against the larger market in general.  For the U.S. Markets, **SPY** is the best proxy for market strength.  In fact, using **SPY** as your benchmark is even more successful than using **QQQ** or Sector Indexes - simply because **SPY** is a better measure of overall investor sentiment.  

As an example, look at the Real Estate Market - and let's say you wanted to invest in buying a home.  In the U.S. the average home price increase 17% in 2021, but in Los Angeles it was almost double that number.  In other words, the home price increases were Relatively Strong in Los Angeles compared to the national average.  

That stat alone is like Relative Strength.  Now would you only use that metric to decide on where to buy a house? No - there are many other pieces of information that should be factored in - school district, neighborhood, assessment of the house itself, etc.  

Every market, whether it is Crypto or Forex or NSE in India has central metrics that indicate the overall strength and investor sentiment.  That means you can compare the equity you are looking with that central metric and note the Relative Strength or Weakness of it.  

***However,*** we know that **SPY** influences the directional price movement of roughly 75-80% of all stocks on the exchange.  Other centralized measures may not be as impactful - so it is important to know for example if changes in the price of **Bitcoin** has an impact on other crypto-currencies and if so what is the limitation of that impact? Does it also impact Alt-Coins? 

We are applying a statistical method of indexing here to help isolate Institutional activity - in other words - *What is Big Money doing?* That method is not unique to the U.S. Stock Market and can be used just about anywhere, you just need to make sure you are using it correctly and in conjunction with other indicators. 

Best, H.S.
