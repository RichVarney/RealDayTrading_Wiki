People are messaging me about how to set up the custom scanner and I figure I'd just share what I'm currently using.

**Remember guys, I'm not a pro or even intermediate trader here yet. Take these templates and make your adjustments to the conditions of the scans to fit what you need. but the layout and PCF code is set up. This setup finds me** ***more than enough*** **good opportunities in a day.**

**Sort your scan columns by any of these to find what you're looking for:**

Buzz = volume of the stock vs it's usual volume that time of day. this is your relative volume.Number to the right of that = Intraday 12 period rolling relative strength (green is rs, red is rw)Number after that = Daily 5 periods rolling relative strengthI have earnings date here too because it's easy to forget it

Volume below 50 day moving average is covered up to focus on just the important candles. this helps you see important lines/breakouts

**Reading rs/rw:**

Green line is  stock strength/weaknessYellow line is  sector strength/weaknessBlue is SPY strength/weakness

intraday is smoothed to take out candle chop(you can see the real data faintly under it, and also shows the average over 1/2 a day of trading with the straight lines. Watch the interplay between these three lines. What seems to work for a strong stock is green over yellow over blue.

Switch the tabs at the top to alternate between HA/regular candles

I also have a layout exactly like these except the scan column is just two watchlists: current positions and "considering" positions. Any good callout or alert goes in the "considering" list then I have a menu of A++ trades to pick.  


I also have just a blank chart that's got a ton of space to try and find algo lines. I am still not great at this and need a ton of practice.
