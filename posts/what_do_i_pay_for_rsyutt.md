I get it - everyone wants everything for free.  And there is a healthy dose of cynicism in this industry towards anyone charging you for any service.  You should be cynical.   According to Credit Suisse the number of new traders has doubled since 2019 - and whenever you get that many new people into any space, you also get scammers trying to fleece them.  For sure, there are *plenty* of scams.  

However, like any career - there are also products and services that can help you a great deal, and when it comes to deciding what to use, the old adage applies - *You get what you pay for.* 

One thing you can be certain of here - free or paid, I will never endorse anything unless I feel it adds value to the members of this sub.    


With that said - here is what I currently pay for to help with trading:

\- **My Set-up**:  *Obviously computers and monitors aren't free - many of you are able to build your own systems, which is great - but most of us cannot.  I used Falcon Computing System to build my desktop and couldn't be happier with the result.  A bit pricey, but no complaints.*

\- **Finviz Elite:** *I really like Finviz, great scanner with a lot of good tools.  Not the best for Day Trading, but the additional features offered with "Elite" is worth it for me - particularly on their after-hours scans and real-time data.*

**- TC2000:** *In my opinion the single best charting software out there, which when combined with their "Flex scans" make this an invaluable resource for me.  Anyone serious about Day Trading should look into it.*

**- One Option:** *In my trading career I have tried many different communities, most were scams, some were good but focused too much on scalping (yes Ross I am looking at you), One Option is the only one that offered a method that is aimed at consistent profitability, a chat room with actual pros, and a great platform (Option Stalker) - It typical pays for itself within the first week.*

\- **Sweeps Data**: *There are many different choices for this information.  I find it valuable, but unless you really know how to use it, I wouldn't recommend spending the money.*

\- **TraderSync:** *You do not want to cheap-out here, having a good trading journal is essential and the free ones just do not give you enough functionality to meet your needs.  I like the interface of TraderSync, but there are many decent choices.*

Clearly if you are just starting out you shouldn't be spending money - most brokers offer great free tutorials on both Stocks and Options, the Wiki here is filled with information, and there are plenty of other free resources you can use to learn.  You can even check some of the standard books out of your public library.  

But once you are ready to start trading seriously, you should invest in your career like any other career out there - just do it wisely and don't waste it on any unvetted service.  If you are ever in doubt - just ask here, we will give you our honest opinion of it.  

Figured this topic was never really discussed, so wanted to quickly write up something on it.

Best, H.S.
