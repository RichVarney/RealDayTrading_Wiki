We all love Options...new traders, bad traders, pro traders, everyone loves to trade Call and Puts.

Some traders are able to construct Option Spreads, and others swear by selling premium - but most traders simply Buy Call or Puts - because, let's face - it's easy. And people like easy.

The Wiki contains some pretty compelling arguments against using OTM Options (I say it is compelling because I wrote it....) and I won't rehash those here.  

What I do want to talk about is what I like to call, **The Option Trap** (I say I like to call it that, but the truth is, I just made it up). 

Let's see if this scenario is familiar - 

Last week **SPY** was looking fairly bearish and on Thursday (1/19) it gapped down below the SMA 50 - and **AAPL** catches your eye as being Relatively Weak, it is at $133 dollars and dropping.  So, you grab the $145 Puts that expire a week away (1/27) for $6.  So far, so good - you are doing everything right.  Market is weak - stock is weak, you took an ITM Option at a delta higher than .65, you're following the rules damnit!

Now let's imagine some potential outcomes:

**1)** **AAPL** continues to drop and by the end of the day it is at $131.20 which means your Put Option is now worth $7.  So what do you do?  You take profit, right?  Hard to trust this market and nobody ever went broke taking a profit, did they?  So you exit the position, perhaps even posting - **Exit AAPL with $1 Profit**.  Maybe you took 5 contracts and made $500 on the trade.  Bully for you!  Yay!  You are a winner and don't let anyone tell you different.

Orrrrrr...

**2)** The market starts going up because **SPY** is a big ole fuckwaffle of an ETF that likes to screw with you, and **AAPL,** while still weak, starts to inch up with it.  By the end of the day **AAPL** is at $133.90 and your Put Options are now worth $4.90. But...the daily chart on **AAPL** still looks bearish and the SMA 50 is above it with some strong resistance.  So you hold.  The next day **SPY** gaps up (because that is what fuckwaffles do) and **AAPL** pops with it, opening at $135.40.  Your Put Option is now worth $3.  But wait! There is a pullback and **AAPL** is dropping!  So you wait.  And wait.  All day the market just chops around, back and forth - **AAPL** hits the SMA 50 and can't break through.  Whew.  I mean you aren't going to close your short when the stock just got rejected at the SMA, are you??  Sigh....the next morning **AAPL** gaps up over the SMA, is at $137.90 and your Put Option is now worth $1.10.  You're about to take the loss but then remember all the times you closed a depleted option only to see it roaring back to life.  Is it really worth it to close it now when it is only worth $1.10?  I mean what if the market starts to drop? It has been known to do that, especially in the past year.  Well, as you probably can imagine, because it is all too real - that option winds up expiring worthless.

Now, let's look at the math:

Let's say there are two outcomes when you buy an Option - you either take $1 Profit or you hold it until it goes to $0. Let's also say that the average price of the Option contracts you buy is $5.

In this case you need to take profit (of $1) **83.3%** of the time just to breakeven. 

But what if you don't let the contract go to $0, what if you either make $1 or you sell the contract for a loss when it is worth $1 (thus, losing $4) - then you need to win **80%** of the time to breakeven.

And if you are a bit more conservative you can either take $1 in profit or close the position when the Option is worth $2 (thus, losing $3) - then you need to take that $1 in profit **75%** of the time in order to breakeven.

In this scenario, even if you decide to close the position with a $3 loss rather than a $5 loss - which is a 40% improvement - your required win-rate only goes from **83.3%**  to **75%** which is a just 10% improvement.  That hardly seems fair!

*The problem is this -* ***While your maximum loss is finite (defined by how much you paid for the option), your potential profit is theoretically - infinite; however, we almost never take advantage of that edge.***

If, for example, on average we took $2 profit instead of $1, and allowed for maximum loss of $5, we would need to be successful **71.5%** of the time.  Compare that to the **83.3%** when only taking $1 profit.

Now imagine instead of saying, "What's the point of closing this when it is only worth $1" you actually reduced your maximum loss to $4 ,while averaging $2 when you win, now your needed win-rate is **66.75%**.

Which brings us to how to avoid this trap of needing an insanely high win-rate to actually make money using Options.

If you are buying a $5 Option, then you need to be taking only *High Probability Trades* that can produce at least a $3 profit on the position (adjust proportionally for higher or lower priced Options).  If you are using a .65 Delta, then on average (considering Gamma and IV as well) you need the stock to go up (or down if it is a Put) by at least $4 and sometimes $5.

Why? Because look what happens when you take $3 profit from a $5 Option - you need to be successful **62.5%** even if you let the Option go to $0 when you lose.

Finally, if you actually closed the Option when it hit only $1 in value, and took $3 in profit on average - now your needed win-rate is only - **57.25%.**

**And there is your solution - being more selective and choosing set-ups that gives you the confidence to hold a profitable position longer - not only reduces the focus on letting the Option lose all of its' value, but it also drops the needed win-rate to just above 50%.**

So often the focus is on learning how to let go of losing positions - and as you see above, taking a $4 loss rather than the full $5 does have an impact - but the real impact comes from raising the average amount of profit each trade produces.  

This is especially true when trading Option which is an asset that loses value over time, and has a finite loss built-in - *you have to take better advantage of your winning positions*.  

***In essence, have more faith in your winners than in your losers.***  When your position is up, and the market/stock continues to give you no reason to exit, then...don't.  Because contrary to popular belief, people go broke taking a profit all the time.
