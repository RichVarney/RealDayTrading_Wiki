Within the world of *short-term* trading there is a constant divide between two schools of thought.  

On the one hand there are those that feel a high *win rate* is a lower priority when it comes to being a profitable trader, and what matters more is your profit ratio.

The other side of the coin are those that put a high *win rate* as a top of requirement for being successful.

I fall squarely on the side of needing a high *win rate* \- particularly given the goal of using trading as your primary source of income.  But let's explore both views:

Let's say you have a $50,000 account and need to make $500 a day to live (roughly a salary of $120,000 a year before taxes).  Obviously, since the following scenarios will be expressed in terms of statistical probability, you can raise or lower the account balance to better reflect your personal circumstances - $50K is just a nice even number to work off.

So let's create some stats for this person:

**Win Rate:** 50%

**Average Trades Per Day:** 20

**Goal:** $500 a day

In order to make $500 a day, with that win rate, they need to make $100 per winning trade, and lose $50 on the losing trades (10 winning trades at $100 = $1,000, 10 losing trades at $50 = $500, Total Profit = $500).

That requires a 2 to 1 profit ratio.

*This is a a good time to introduce an important concept - the higher your required profit ratio, the lower the number of potential setups there are that will meet that requirement.*  

In this scenario you would need to find **20** trades that can potentially give you a 2 to 1 return.  If you are buying a $5 option, you need it to go to $6 as your target, and $4.50 is your stop.  If you are buying 100 shares of a $100 stock, you need that stock to hit $101 and have a $99.50 as your stop.

Since price action should dictate your stops (whether mental or hard), you must now hunt for opportunities that allow for this ratio.  

What if you reduced your number of average trades to 10?  Now you need to find 5 trades that you make $200 on, while only losing $100 on the other 5 trades.  Now that $100 stock needs to go to $102, with a stop at $99.  

You could increase your number of shares on the trade, to 500, in which case you would be looking for the $100 stock to hit $100.40, but now your stop is also tighter and rests at $99.80.  

This is doable, but because your stop is going to be tight on a stock that is moving with some volume, you will also be shutting down trades that do not violate any technical exit points.   Your mediocre *win rate* does not allow for your trades to mature and breathe. 

*So what happens if your raised your win rate to 80%?*  

**Win Rate: 80%**

**Average Trades Per Day: 20**

***Everything changes.***

If you stayed at 20 trades a day, you are now winning 16 of them (*btw - I hope by now I have shown that an 80% win rate is definitely doable.  While the 53 winning trades in a row like I had last week is not going to be the norm for anyone, 8 out of 10 definitely is obtainable).*   

Now you only need to make $50 per winning trade, and you can stand to lose $75 on the ones that don't work out.   *Or* you could make $40 per winning trade, and lose $35 on the ones that don't work.

On a $100 stock, your target would only need to be $100.50, while your stop could be at $99.25.  Having that disparity, with your need for profit lower than your tolerance for loss also serves to increase the win rate, thus the two concepts support each other. 

Another possibility is you can now lower the average number of trades, allowing you to be more selective.  Let's say you cut the number of trades in half to 10, and with an 80% win rate you are winning 8 and losing 2.  In this scenario you need to make $75 per winning trade and can tolerate a loss of $50 per losing trade.  

Increasing the *win rate* allows you to:

**Lower the average number of trades needed per day, allowing you to be more selective**

**Lowers the amount of profit needed per trade**

**Increases the amount of loss you can withstand per trade**

*These three adjustments give you, the trader, a* ***huge*** *amount of flexibility and opportunities to succeed.*  

*The higher the win rate - the easier it is to hit your target, find good trades and tolerate higher volatility within a trade.*

It also has a immeasurable psychological impact.  I can remember one of my first jobs in college, it was for a telemarketer, selling businesses an "800 number".  As you can imagine, being a telemarketer means you are rejected - **a lot**.  I was pretty good at it (although my methods at the time might be considered somewhat immoral I imagine), but many people could not stand the constant negative feedback. In a job where you are told "no" 99 times out of a 100, it gets to a person.  Most people quit because they couldn't deal with constant failure - even though that failure was the norm.  

It is the same with trading - the higher the *win rate* the higher your confidence will be - and *confidence* is **extremely** important in this line of work.  The psychological impact of having a low *win rate* is real and takes a toll on even the best traders out there.

Now let's reverse the scenario:

Same person, same account balance, and same need for a profit of $500 a day - but:

**Win Rate: 20%**

**Average Trades Per Day: 20**

You now need to average $500 per win (4 wins out of 20 = $2,000) and only withstand a loss of $93.75 (16 losses out of 20 = $1,500).   That is a profit ratio of 5.33 to 1.  

Now for that $100 stock, you need to hit $105 as your profit target, while only allowing for a loss that has a stop at $99.06.  

And you need to find **4** setups a day that give you this return.  On most days, the only situation that allows for this are low-float gappers, or news-based catalysts on cheap stocks.  

If a stock was at $10, and you bought 1,000 shares (same cost as the 100 share trade of the $100 stock), you need it to hit $10.50 before it hits $9.91.  However, by the very nature of these types of trades, there is a huge amount of volatility - meaning, you are now dealing with needing a tight stop on a stock that is experiencing huge swings in price.   And yet, you absolutely have to succeed 20% of the time without that stop being triggered.  

The chances of finding **20** of these trades a day, where **4** will be successful is almost nil. 

You could reduce the average number of trades to **10**, but then what happens?  You need to make $1,000 per winning trade, while only tolerating a loss of $187.50 on the 8 you lose**.**  

Now the $10 stock would have to hit $11, before you stopped out at $9.81.  And you have to find **10** of these trades a day, to have a chance of being successful at two of them. 

*However, it gets even worse -*

The chance of going two days in a row without having a winning trade, with a *win rate* of 20% is - 10.89%. That means 11% of the time you are now losing on average, $1,875 each day. 

Imagine you are doing this for a living, and depending on the income to support yourself and your family - and the first two days of the month has you down $3,750.  This is going to happen 11% of the time.  Your goal of $10,000 profit a month, just became $13,750 needed - and you have two less days to do it.  Which means you need to now make $764 a day for the rest of the month; however, your strategy still only provides a win rate of 20% - i.e. - you are in trouble. 

The huge Standard Deviation that is inherent with a low *win rate* creates immense instability.  It also means you have to find very specific set-ups that allow for a 5.3 to 1 return, and you need to find at least 10 of them a day.  

See the problem?

*That is no way to make a living.*

*So yes, people will say - win rate is crap, you can have a 10% win rate and still be really profitable.  Sure, it is true - but it is not as simple as it sounds.  In fact, it is highly unlikely.*  There are only a rare few out there that can successfully pull-off the type of trading that is profitable with a low *win rate*, and it took them a very long time to get to that point.

Remember, the goal is to get to the point where you are *trading for a living*. And trading for a living, demands *consistency,* which means - a high *win rate is essential*.
