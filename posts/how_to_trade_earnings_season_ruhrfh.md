The next earning season is upon us and like anything else in the market it provides an opportunity to make a lot money, and also a chance to blow up your account - unfortunately, a lot of people wind up doing the latter.

Let's start with this - ***Don't try to predict earnings, and definitely do not try to predict an earnings reaction.***

I constantly see people trying to guess at whether a company is going to *crush* their earnings or not simply based on their anecdotal observations.  Just because you really liked *Witcher Season 2* and so did all of your friends, does not mean that **NFLX** is going to have good earnings.

Also, many times it is the future outlook that is just as important, if not more important, than the earnings themselves.  And no, this also doesn't mean that just because you think we are all going to be living in a *Ready Player One* world soon that **FB** is going to have great guidance going forward.

You know what else you don't know?  How much is actually baked into the stock price.  **PFE** looks like it is about to get FDA approval? Great - chances are that has already been priced in.  This is why you often see companies blow away expectations, and then watch as their stock price falls off a cliff.  

Price movement from earnings is dictated by Institutional buying, selling or inaction.  You will see what they are doing *after* the earnings are announced.  Is there a way to scalp a reaction in *After Hours*, yes - but unless you are very experienced in scalping, do not try it.

Next - ***Definitely do not buy straight Options and hold them over earnings.***  

It works like this - Stock ABC has earnings after the close on a Tuesday - their stock is at $250 right now.   Normally the ATM Call Options ($250 strike) with three days until expiration would go for $2.  But right now they are going for $5.25 - and that is because of **IV** (Implied Volatility).  If the market feels the stock is expected to have a wide range of movement in the price, IV increases.  It is common to see IV over 100% as the earnings date approaches.  IV plays a large role in determining the price of the option.  So that extra $3.25 you are paying for that call?  That is due to IV.   

If you bought that call, not only would you have to get the direction of the move correct (which is a total crapshoot when it comes to earnings), but the move would have to exceed that of the expectations.  In other words, Stock ABC would need to move up more than $5.25 in order for you to make a profit.  Now you may be thinking - what is Stock ABC moved up $4 - now it is $254, wouldn't the $250 calls be worth more than $5.25 if they were worth that when the stock was at $250?  No - because once earnings are announced and the reaction is assessed IV drops like a rock, known as *IV Crush*.  This depresses the price of the Options and puts increased pressure on the price to drive the premium.    

In other words, you will have several things going against you:

\- *Coin-flip on getting the directional move correct*

\- *IV going down and depressing the Option price*

\- *Stock could go up and you still lose money*

It is just not a smart play.  And if you look historically at Stock ABC, you will most likely find that the typical move after earnings is going to be lower than what you need to make a profit - Market Makers aren't stupid.

***However - there are two Option plays you can do over earnings:***

**1) Time Spread -** u/onewyse described this quite well here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/qhdoy9/profiting\_from\_time\_spreads\_calendar\_spreads\_over/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/qhdoy9/profiting_from_time_spreads_calendar_spreads_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**2) Bracketed Butterflies -** Let's say **AMZN** which is at $3330 typically moves +/-$80 after earnings.  You don't know which way it will go, but it is reasonable to assume it will move one way or another (i.e. it is not going to stay at $3330 after the announcement).  So you do a Call Butterfly $3380/$3410/$3440 and a Put Butterfly $3280/$3250/$3220.   Each of these should give you roughly 7 to 1 all the way to 12 to 1 on your money.  

**It should also be noted that you don't need to play** ***over*** **earnings to make money** ***because*** **of earnings.**

Historically some stocks tends to rally into their earnings date.  *OptionStalker* has a search for this where it gives you all the stocks that tend to go up in price as the earnings date approaches more than 75% of the time.  So over the past 12 earnings announcements, it would give you stocks that had bullish runs more than 9 times out of 12 as the date approached.  You can also look for yourself - it is fairly easy - create a list of all the stocks you have traded over the past year or six months and just look at their charts - do they tend to increase in price before each earnings date?  

For these stocks you want to catch them right as they go on their run - so you go to their charts and place alerts - you are looking for points of a bullish breakout.  If they are in consolidation then put the alerts right above the horizontal resistance.  If they are below SMA's on the daily chart, put alerts for when they breach those lines.  

When you get an alert triggered, you want to make sure the market is in your favor and then you are looking to buy Calls that have a Delta of .65 or higher.  *You are not holding these over earnings even if the expiration date is after the announcement.*  Because of earnings, the IV will continue to increase as it approaches, meaning your Options will hold their value with Theta being negated.  Even a small move upwards in the stock price will produce a decent profit on these calls. 

So there you have it - if you want to play earnings season - use one of the methods described here, but please stop with the OTM Calls that almost *always* get destroyed. 

Best, H.S.
