I took 100 points out of /ES - S&P Futures today (picture below from 45 minutes before the market closed), and throughout the day I got many questions about various support levels, the 8EMA, even Fib retracements.

Here's the thing - this was low volume, panic selling due to an external piece of news that freaked out investors.  

There are times when technical analysis is not going to give you guidance - this was one them.  Why? Because technical analysis is based on a group consensus of various price points that are buy or sell signals. However:

*When there is low volume and panic selling (or buying), there* ***is no group consensus.***

At that point it is just about the price action - simply using Heiken Ashi candles gave me all the information I needed.  Look at the chart from today using HA candles on the M5:

You have your short at the beginning and the at 10:25am you take profits, you have a short again at 10:55am and you take profits at 11:30am, you go long at 12:05pm, take profits at 12:15pm and then go long again at 12:25pm, take profits at 12:40pm, and then short at 12:45pm.

Look at where I was at roughly 12:15pm today, trading **only one** contract of /ES:

Know when to stop looking at a million indicators, and just following the trend (which is what HA candles do).  There was nothing particularly difficult, or requiring a lot of experience in what I did today with SPY Futures - in fact, it was the opposite - clean and simple.

Best, H.S.
