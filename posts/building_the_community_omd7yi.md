When I started r/RealDayTrading I did not expect it to grow as fast as it did.  Now we are nearly at a thousand members and I am starting to appoint mods to help keep the sub in line with its' mission statement.

When I see so many people trying to make money in the market, whether they are from r/wallstreetbets, r/Daytrading, r/options or r/StockMarket, I can tell that they all have one thing in common - everyone is trying to make a better life for themselves.  Most of us were born into a world that allows those with wealth to have limitless opportunities to create more wealth - opportunities that we do not have access to, that are blocked off from us legally and financially.   

And that is what everyone is trying to do - get a piece of the economy that has been denied to us all of our lives.  Some throw caution to the wind, while others tread more carefully - but in the end the only way to come out ahead is by truly balancing the scales.  To have an edge, and use it.

My hope is that r/RealDayTrading will become the place where those who have been able to successfully find and use that edge, can help those who have not.  A community where we all work together towards the common goal of creating our own wealth, allowing for financial freedom and independence.

However, I can only do that with your help - so please let me know any and all suggestions you may have to improve our forum.  The more our community is built through the ideas of everyone involved, the better it will become.

Thank you and I hope you are all enjoying your weekend as we await the opening bell on Monday!
