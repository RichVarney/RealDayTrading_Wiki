**Example 1: Betrayal!**

You go long stock **FAFO** at $100.20.  Stock is bullish, market is bullish, daily chart is bullish - it broke through its SMA 100 on the Daily, and has higher than average volume.  Great choice by you! You're a champ.

But right after you get the shares, **FAFO** drops to $99.85, back below its SMA 100 (a breach you never confirmed).  That's ok, only down .35 - not a problem.  Sure you took 500 shares in a $15,000 account  (using Day Trading Buying Power), but whatever, it's fine, hell, the market is still strong!  

Market drops.  

**FAFO** had *Relative Strength* but for some reason known only to the God of **You're Fucked** it no longer does...and now **FAFO** is at $99.25, down .95.  Still, support is at $98.25 and unless it breaks through that, your thesis is still intact.  Besides, it is not like this stock is never going to be above $100.20 again, right??  

Shit, you can't trade because all your money is tied up in this damn stock, in fact your Option Buying Power is now negative.  Well, there goes the idea of "waiting it out"  

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Four fucks.  It is at $98.50- down $1.70, and you are now down $850 on the trade.    Maybe you should just cut it, but it is so close to support, I might as well wait it out.

Yes! It bounced back up!  $99.25.  Getting closer.  Market going up too....this is great, I've been saved!

It hits $100.20 - your entry.  You exit. **Break-Even**.

**Verdict:** **You. Fucked. Up.**

In this scenario, your thesis was finally starting to work and the stock was just about to do exactly what you thought it would and you.....exited.  You got so freaked out by the prospect of losing and did not want to have the position go back into the red that you took the scratch.  Going through your mind is one thing - "If this stock drops again and I could have gotten out at break-even I will be beside myself with murderous rage!" (perhaps not that severe, but you get the point).  

***You*** ***no longer trusted the trade. It already caused you emotional pain and now you wanted out of the relationship.*** 

In the fucked-up heads of traders, the position *betrayed your trust,* it went down when you thought it was going to go up, it made you anxious and now you're supposed to just carry on like nothing happened??  No fucking way. Gone. **FAFO** you lost out...because you lost.... E!

But just like in so many of your real life relationships, if you look back you will realize **FAFO** did nothing wrong, it acted how it is supposed to act.  The stock pullback back with some profit taking, went down to test support, and then bounced right back up ready to go, but it was too late, you were gone.  

At the end of the day **FAFO** was at $102.17, and enjoying life with someone else.

**Example 2:  Gotta have Hope!**

You short **GTFO** at $43.65.  The stock has fallen below all three major MA's on the daily chart.  It gapped down today (as did the entire sector/industry), and broke below daily compression.  Volume is good, and the stock is weak to **SPY,** and on top of that **SPY** is dropping faster than your bank balance.  Another winning choice. *Madmartigan,* *you ARE great!*

But then Fed speaker Fucktwit says, "This feels like a good time for a pause in the hikes so we can assess any lag impacts on the economy".  Well, the market certainly liked that!  **SPY** goes up like a rocket and since **GFTO** is in the Tech sector, it pops as well.  Within two candles the stock is at $44.30.  You are down .65, but you bought 1,000 shares (because you are a greedy motherfucker), so you are down $650.  

However, **GTFO** still hasn't broken it's Resistance from a downward sloping Algo line at $45.10, nor has it breached the SMA200 which is at $45.60.  I mean you were smart, super smart even!  You made sure this short not only ticked off every box, but that there were multiple levels of Resistance in place. 

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Four Fucks again.  **GTFO** just smashed through that Algo line and threw its hands in the air like it just didn't care.  That little bastard is now at $45.30,   You are now down, $1.65.  That's $1,650.  Think about what you could have done with that money,   You could have gotten your kid that Playstation 5 with like 10 games and still had money left over.  Think about how happy your child would have been.  And now you have lost that money. It's gone.  Depressing isn't?  All because Fed Fucktwit decided to start shit.  Makes you want to pull a Will Smith and smack the shit of out him, saying, "Keep rate hikes out of your damn mouth!"

Well, you can't close it now, you just can't - if you do, that money is lost and there's no Playstation (that you weren't going to buy anyway).  So now you have to hope the SMA holds.  

Shit. Market just closed.  I need to wait until tomorrow.

Yeah. Bad fucking idea.  The next day tech is leading the way and **GTFO** gaps up to $46.25.  You are now down $2.60, or $2,600.  Fuck the Playstation, you could have gone on a family trip.  You could have used the money to fix shit around the house.  You could have bought an awesome new TV, or a new laptop.  Now you are really depressed and you close the trade.

**Verdict: You. Fucked. Up. Again.**  

You held an underwater short that was heating up with the entire sector on a News-based bounce....overnight??  What the hell is wrong with you?!?!  No. No. No. No.  

Fine, the first bounce up wasn't your fault.  Fed Fucktwit screwed it up for everyone that was short Tech.  You can't predict that.  But the reason you held is because you had a position so fucking large that you could not stomach the idea of taking the loss.  

You held it because at least then there is....hope.  Hope that tomorrow will restore sanity to the market and **GTFO** will resume its downward spiral.  

If this was 300 shares you know you would have closed it. A loss of $495 isn't fun, but you can stand it. You just could not take the idea of losing that much money when there is a chance that you can still somehow get out unscathed.   

***All of that analysis, all of your strategy, was reduced to - hope.***  

Let's please stop that shit? Ok?

**Example 3: Never Went Broke Taking A Profit**

Dayummmm **GFY** is looking tight! I mean, earnings were fit as shit, and **GFY** glammed up!  Going from $120.35 to $134.20 overnight!  Right through all Resistance levels, and now the fucker is at an all-time high.  That's right. Ain't nobody holding bags above this price. Volume is strong. Market is strong. **GFY** is hella strong.  You're gonna shoot your shot. Bam - Long **GFY** at $134.20 . 

And sure, you only have $27,000 in the account, but you have $108,000 in buying power baby!  Go big or go home right? (although, you're already home most likely....just sayin) 750 Shares!

Aight...it consolidating.  Totes fine.  Let it do its thing.  It wants to hang between $133.90 and $134.30 that's fine with you.  As long as it kicks those candles and pops soon.

It does!  That's what I'm talking about!  Boo-ya! $135.20. Exit. Out. Boy, Bye.  $1 Profit.  $750 in my pocket (or in your account and we don't think about the fact it will never make its way to your pocket).  

"Nice trade" says everyone.  You beam with pride.  Hell yeah it was a nice trade.

**Verdict: You. Dumb. Shit.**

Here you have a stock that is clearly bullish off earnings.  Hitting an all-time high, which is statistically where stocks are most likely to continue to run up.  Breaks out of consolidation and pops up on a strong market.  Literally everything you want that stock to do.

Do you add to the trade? You still have some buying power left, you could even supplement it will Call Options.  Nah...you don't even think about that.

Do you just let it ride, and wait until it seems like there is actually Resistance? Nah....you briefly think about it, but why throw away a nice $750 win?

**This is exactly where you hold on to the stock. It is literally the best possible scenario for that trade.**  

You don't see any of that because your mindset is still - "You won and managed to take money out of the market", you still see that as *beating the odds.*  You didn't lose.  It is like you see the market as a casino and cashing in winnings is beating the house. 

What you are not realizing is that "winning" should be the norm,  it is the *expectation* when you trade.  You're not "getting away with something" when you make a profit. Trading is not about "take the money and run".  

Are there situations where you should quickly take profit? Of course there is, but your mindset cannot differentiate between them.   There is a difference between taking a profit on a trade in a choppy market with a stock that has some *Relative Strength,* and going long on a stock that is at an all-time high, breaking compression, and coming off earnings.  

It is not only learning the difference, but also realizing that, yes, you should be up that $1 and not only that....you should be looking for a lot more! 

***Stop taking profit too damn fast!***

***Best, H.S.***
