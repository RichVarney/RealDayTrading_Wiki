Hello everyone,

First off, I want to thank you all for being active members of the sub. We have a unique opportunity to create a legitimate trading sub on Reddit, and it is our responsibility as members of the sub to make meaningful contributions and help one another. I think we can all agree that we do **not** want this sub to look anything like other trading subs on Reddit. Like it says in our sidebar,

“Our goal is to efficiently educate as many people as possible through the advice and perspective of professional day traders. This does not mean we are here to argue if day trading is gambling, individual trades, or any other nonsensical topics. When u/HSeldon2020 began r/RealDayTrading, he believed that other subreddits dedicated to the practice were lackluster in educating consistent trading practices and he wanted to provide a better path to learning how to make day trading into a career. As a community, we hope to follow this exact mindset by being laser-focused on how to make consistent profits through day trading and create a career out of it.”

The key here is that Hari wants to help us become **professional** day traders. We are here to make a living as professional day traders – not to have a hobby.

Imagine that you work as a trader at a hedge fund. Your team has a live chat to discuss trade ideas, which is great and benefits you all, until suddenly a new hire comes in and starts flooding the chat with questions that they could easily find answers to on Google, question every trade you make, and go on about how their wife’s boyfriend took them on a date behind the dumpster at Wendy’s. As you could imagine, this would never happen (if it did, you could find the guy over at r/byebyejob). Why? Because there is an expectation of *professionalism*. It is extremely difficult to get in the zone and concentrate when someone questions every move you make – it tends to psych you out! *Acting* professional is an important part of *becoming* professionals in any field, including day trading.

Pete (u/OptionStalker) posted a [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TXDAhan24s&ab_channel=OneOption) today in which he shows some of the dialogue in the Option Stalker chat. I invite all of you to watch this video and think of ways that you can help create a similar environment in our subreddit, especially in the daily chat. And seriously, watch Pete's videos. They are chock full of valuable information.

Moving forward, we will be setting up a separate chat for general dialogue and questions to try and reduce clutter and distractions in the trading chat. It is okay to ask questions and get to know one another – but the trading chat is not the place to do it, especially during market hours. I will be stricter about removing comments and muting users from this point on in order to create a more professional environment - but since we cannot (and really do not want to) police every comment, we ask that you self moderate by asking yourself, *“Does this question/comment belong here?”* before posting. If someone is not following the rules, please remind them that this is a professional environment.

Note: Do not feel bad about asking questions! You will not be ridiculed even if it seems simplistic - just make sure you do your own research and post the question outside the trading chat and someone will happily answer you. Ridicule is rarely allowed on this sub (read the Wiki).

Hari made some great comments regarding this topic, so I will post it here:

“Going to give some of you some tips that will be useful if you are in any chat that isn't on discord (because there - anything goes). Much like at a poker table there are rules of decorum.

1. If a trade goes against someone, you don't say, "Ooof", or "shit bad trade" or anything like that - trust me the trader is well aware of the trade and what is happening. CSCO bounced off the algo support line, which institutions drove it down to before buying it up off that guidance number for example. Unless you know things like where the algo support line is, you don't add color commentary. The correct type of comment is , "Seems CSCO is selling off, Support looks to be around 57, will be interesting to see how much of a bounce it gets". The other type of comments fucks with a traders head. This also pertains to running commentary like, "AAPL keeps going, short is screwed" - AAPL is going because the market is going, whenever SPY dipped AAPL dipped.
2. You don't constantly ask a trader if they are still in a position - it basically is saying, "Hey I followed you into this, and now I am depending on you to get out." That is a lot of pressure to put on any trader. Instead comment on your own position, like, "Still holding MSFT, I like how it broke through previous high and kept strong volume, thinking of swinging it, any thoughts, especially given the market strength?"
3. Don't ask constant questions about why or how someone entered a trade open ended, ask it with technical analysis - "Seems like WYNN is above VWAP and has RS, is there something else you see that makes you want to short it? Are you using it as a hedge based on the daily chart?"

If you want to be traders, you need to act like professional traders. These tips aren't just for here, trust me, you will want to follow these in any chat room you find yourself, and you should never find yourself in a Discord chat.”
