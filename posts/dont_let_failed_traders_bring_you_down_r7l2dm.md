EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

I have to admit - I avoided Reddit for a long time. This platform is notorious for the sheer number of trolls that seem drawn to any popular post.

This Day Trading Sub is clearly not immune to that phenomenon.

I see many on here ask great questions and others giving excellent advice/feedback. It’s those people that make forums like this an excellent resource.

Sadly though I also see a number of people whose primary goal seems to be to tear down any sign of success. If you look through their comment history you’ll find a clear trend of negativity.

My theory? These are failed Day Traders, and they are angry. They’ve convinced themselves that it is impossible to make money Day Trading - because if others can do it, why can’t they??

Unfortunately new Day Traders are intimidated enough as it is, worried they are going to lose money and looking at a steep learning curve. It doesn’t take much to push them into believing that Day Trading isn’t an option (pun intended).

These past 7-8 months has attracted more people to trading than ever before - they are at home more now, perhaps they need income, or a new career. And instead of providing education and encouragement, these disgruntled failed traders stalk the subs looking to tear down any optimism in the name of “hard truth”.

Well, I’m here to tell you all who are thinking of taking up Day Trading - ignore them. Yes it’s hard, and yes there is a steep learning curve. There’s no “get rich quick” scheme and you shouldn’t fall for the constant barrage of those claiming to have the “magic bullet”. But - It is doable. Everyone has their own style, but the foundations of it can be picked up by anyone and built upon.

So don’t let those that couldn’t hack it due to their own failings bring you down. I’m a profitable Day Trader, I know many profitable Day Traders, and with dedication you can become one as well.
