I’ve seen a few posts lately asking for trade reviews, or wondering how to enter and exit a trade, asking if this pullback or that bounce or this 3/8 cross or whatever else on the ticker is a good signal.  I haven’t seen much discussion about what the market is doing at time of entry or exit, however, and, as Pete (u/OptionStalker) and Hari remind us constantly: **MARKET FIRST.**  

Here is an example from today on how I do it, and how I traded FISV and when AND WHY I exited all my short positions at the same time.

I have my thesis for SPY and this will guide my trades.

We have a gap down after a high-volume selloff, so I’m expecting some retracement if I don’t see red stacking candles with little to no overlap and increasing volume (Here is a [MASTER LESSON](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/xy8756/bearish_trend_days_how_to_spot_them_and_how_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/OptionStalker on trading gaps down and bear trend days). I also have a couple of levels I’m looking at: Low of day, high of day, 1/2 way up the gap, yesterday’s close.  I am bearish until SPY confirms ABOVE 1/2 of the gap with volume, and after yesterday I’m not bullish unless I see high volume, stacking greens, etc etc. 

So I pick my ticker to trade (how is beyond the scope of this quick post and there is a ton of info in the wiki) and I’m watching SPY.  I enter at #1 because of the big red engulfing candle.  I expect to see immediate follow-through and I don’t get it.  Ok, now I want to see 1/2 of that red candle defended and I enter an order to add to my position a little below the 1/2 point.  I get filled at #2 ON SPY, NOT FISV. I determined FISV is very weak and under algo, and at that point I don’t care about FISV. 

Now I’m looking for continuation down on SPY through VWAP.  I don’t get it. In fact, the big red candle is erased by a big green candle.  hmmm.  But I’m still bearish and that green candle is very low volume for its size so I hold.  As SPY gets close to the 1/2 point of the GAP I add to my trade again at #3 and I keep holding.  If SPY confirms above the GAP then I take the loss.  

SPY touches and reverses.  At this point, I’m looking for continuation into a NLOD and increasing volume into and through VWAP.  My plan is now to add again to the trade if SPY confirms below VWAP and exit 1/2 to 3/4 at NLOD, and exit if it stalls or reverses. 

SPY clears VWAP and  reverses and, at this point, I exit FISV AND ALL OTHER SHORT POSITIONS (AMZN, FISV, GPN, SPY).  Why?  My thesis is now broken.  There is no new low of day and we will either make a new high and continue, or chop around for the time being, or make a NLOD.  I don’t know and have no clarity, so I take my money off of the table and wait.

At any point am I looking at FISV? not very closely.  Yea I’m a little underwater, but I can hold and it’s weak. I’m more concerned with what SPY is doing and whether I went in too early, before SPY set a trend (I did). 

I hope this helps, and I look forward to seeing more ‘review my trades’ questions focused on what SPY is doing at the moment.

Keep chasing the dream
