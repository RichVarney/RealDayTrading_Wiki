Let me get this part out of the way - 

**This is the hardest market I have ever traded. Period. Bar none.**

And it is not just me - I asked various pro-traders what they thought, people who have been trading back in 2007-2009 and they were unanimous - *This market is extremely difficult to trade with consistently profitable results.*

Did Powell's talk and the resulting surge that brought **SPY** over the 200 SMA, and over all major SMA's for the first time since April kick off a new bullish cycle?  We can hope - I doubt it though.  At best it may have sparked a nice year-end rally though - however, this downtrend trendline remains intact:

Optimism about exiting this Bear market needs to be seriously tempered until we breach that line, and even then Q1 earnings has the potential to completely wreck **SPY** early 2023.  That means we are basically stuck in a range right now between $404 and $409 (SMA 200 and Downward Trendline) - which also means that everything that happens between those two price-points is just **noise**.  Obviously there will be individual stocks that stand out but there is no way to say the market is either **Bullish** or **Bearish** until one of those levels is breached.  I *lean* toward the **Bearish** side only because the SMA 200 as support is weaker than the Resistance above, and **SPY** needs a catalyst to get through that Resistance but doesn't need one to break below the SMA 200. 

Still at some point this horror show will become a distant memory, one of those, "Yeah, I remember the Bear Market of 2022" with that thousand yard stare in your eyes.  It may even become trading social currency to know that someone traded their way through this and made it out alive.

For many of you this is all you know.  It's like 18-24 year old's looking at the state of the political system in the U.S. and asking, "Is this normal?"  - No, no it is not normal at all. 

You are used to day after day of *chop* and *sudden-reversals* and you learned on this fucking crap.  So many of you never had the pleasure of taking calls on **AAPL**, waiting a few days and then closing it for huge profit. Just constant no pressure trades, one after another. Can you even imagine that? The grizzled veterans amongst us can, although the memory of it is fading I am sure. 

Learning how to trade in this market is truly like the Navy Seals Bootcamp of Trading and many of you have rang that bell to exit (and I can't blame you).  The good news is if you follow the Wiki, trade with small size (like 1 share or Paper), you can make it through relatively unscathed but with a ton of knowledge.   Imagine learning how to drive in Manhattan, during a blizzard and then when you finally make it out alive you get to drive on small town roads and nice long highways with little traffic.  Can you still get into an accident? Of course - but your chance of getting to your destination is a hell of a lot higher than it was before.

So that is the good news - you will be well trained.  Here's the bad news - you may also have trading *PTSD*.  Once we finally get to a Bull Market you may have a hard time trusting it.  Because this tortuous piece of shit trading environment we have right now will have left you with emotional scars - the most notable is a mistrust of *technical analysis*.  **And that is very very bad.**

Putting aside the occasional macro-socioeconomic thesis on the market, or selling Puts on a company you like fundamentally, *technical analysis is what separates trading from gambling*. When we begin to doubt whether or not TA is working then the entire basis for our trades falls apart.  The past year has certainly done nothing to instill confidence in the conceptual use of ***Support/Resistance***.  Time and time again we have seen S/R break as if it wasn't there..  Trends have failed, and *Relative Strength/Weakness* reversed constantly throughout the day.  I am sure many times you have sat there thinking, "I followed all the rules, checked all the boxes and still lost! I don't know what I am doing wrong?!?!"  That can only happen so many times before you begin to mistrust the market on an instinctual/emotional level.  When that sets in your trades becomes dictated by *Fear* .  Traders have a difficult enough time overcoming the various *Fear-based* Mindset problems that plagued most people when they begin.  **This fear though is instilled from experience and that is even more difficult to overcome.** 

The best thing you can do is to recognize if you have it and always ask yourself, "Am I entering/exiting this position and am I using this position size because of, fear?"  For example, one of the benefits of a Bull Market is the ability to add to your winners - which is difficult to do when all you can remember are times when adding to your winners resulted in a big loss.  

I am working on a technique that can help overcome this but in the meantime I would love to hear your stories - how has this Bear Market impacted you mentally and has it changed the way you trade? How do you think it will affect your trading when we are in a Bull Market?

If we work on this problem now, then when we finally do have a Bull Market we can collectively be ready to take full advantage of it!

Best, H.S.
