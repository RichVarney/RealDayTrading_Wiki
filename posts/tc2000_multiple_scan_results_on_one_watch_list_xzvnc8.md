I have been using TC2000 for charting and scanning for many years and love how helpful it is in identifying high probability trade setups. I am finding that many traders using TC2000 aren't aware that many different scan results can be displayed on one watch list. TC2000 only allows 1 real time scan without paying additional fees for 4 or 10 real time scans but there is a very effective way to have many near real time scan results showing on one list. I have my 900 stock list as my watchlist but you can use any watchlist you like even all stocks. The watch list can have an unlimited number of columns that are usually used for volume buzz, volume, % change etc. You can add columns to the list and those columns can be for any scan results you have such as HA reversals 5 min, HA reversals daily, compression breaks, volume surge last 5 minutes etc. You add a column by clicking on the orange circle at the right side of the column list. That allows you to add a column for a value of a condition and the condition can be the result of any of the individual scans you have. One the conditional scan has been set for a column go to properties on the conditional column you just added and use check marks and dots of a specific color so when your watchlist is viewed it will have all the conditions you added column for identified by a colored dot or check. Then by clicking on the column heading of the condition you want to see they will all sort to the top additionally all other conditions you selected will have colored dots or checks for those that also were currently occurring. By this method you can find stocks meeting any condition you want as well as a stock with multiple conditions being met at the same time. An example would be a HA bullish HA reversal coming out of compression with a volume surge or any combinations you want but your results will not confined to only the specific condition or conditions you have a scan set for. It can be used in lieu of 5 or 6 separate scans that you have to keep switching between depending upon what you are looking for. I think this will simplify your search for high probability stock setups.
