***This guide is by far the most important post any new, or struggling trader, should read.***

**There are NO short-cuts to this!**

**These steps have a constant** ***proof-of-concept*** **that anyone can see - testimonial after testimonial in this community of those that have followed it, and are now successful traders.**

**There are also many posts and comments from those that have tried to "cut corners" or try multiple paths forward at once - most, if not all, have failed to reach consistent profitability.**

**This will take time - on average it takes roughly 2-years.  Some of have done it in less time, and others have taken longer.  Do not compare yourself to anyone.  There are people that have all the free time in the world to do nothing but learn this skill.  There are others that have to try to fit in a few hours on the weekend to learn.**

***Everyone is different.***

*How do I get started?*

By far that is the most asked question from traders that I come across.

*How do I stop the bleeding and start making money?*

And that is the second most asked question from traders I get.

*For those that are trading but, losing money, you may have already completed some of these steps (e.g. Choose a Broker), and may think you know some others (e.g.. Learn).  For the steps you have already completed, feel free to skip them, for the parts you think you already know - redo them, because obviously you do not know as much as you might think.*

As you go through these, remember - the point of this process is to make **trading your full-time job**.  This is what you will be doing for a living.

Think about all the crap one has to deal with just to go up the corporate ladder and finally get some small crappy office with a salary of $150,000?  **Years and years of crap.**  How many years does someone have to put in at the factory before they finally get promoted?

***People spend a good portion of their life just trying to get ahead in a job they don't like, working for a company that doesn't care about them.***

Being a Full-Time Trader *is everything you would think it is, and more*.  You get up and go to the "office" which is right in your own house.  You make your own decisions, and it is your own skill level that determines how far ahead you get.  There is no boss (although some would say the Market is your boss) and you are truly the master of your own fate.

Given that -  ***2 years*** is not much time and effort in comparison - particularly when you think of the amazing job you will have at the end of the journey.

***Ok - with all of that out of the way - here is the revamped 10-Steps.***

**Step 1:** ***Choose A Broker*** \-

As a general rule, once you have your broker it is really hard to break-away and try another platform.  A comfort level develops and gets to the point that the idea of moving your cash and learning a new interface is usually enough to keep people with the same broker all throughout their trading career.  So this is a rather important step considering you will be spending hours every day using whichever one you decide upon now.

To begin with - **stay away from any mobile-only broker (i.e.** ***Robinhood***\*\*)\*\* they suck.  It might seem convenient and easy, but just imagine this for a moment - *You hire an accountant, meet at their home because they don't have an office, and show her all your finances.  You're fully expecting them to go to their computer to start up QuickBooks or something similar, but instead they take out their phone and start entering your financial into an App called NumberTime! - How comfortable would be? Would you think this person is taking their job seriously?* Obviously you wouldn't use that accountant.

You want a broker that you can use on your computer, and has a good trading platform (I like *ThinkorSwim*, but *Interactive Brokers*, *TradeStation*, *Fidelity*, *Traider*. etc are all fine).  Some brokers have better charting software, others are easier to place trades with, etc, it just depends on what matters most to you, so do your research. You'll want something that will serve your needs both now and down the road.  That means brokers advertising themselves as being great for beginners, may work well at first , but can become very limiting as time progresses.  One thing is a **must-have**, the platform must allow you to *paper trader (i.e. trade with fake money)* with \*real-time data (\*once again *ThinkorSwim* is excellent for this). You also will want to compare the *fees*.  Options have fees, Futures have fees, hell every trade has hidden fees.  It is not uncommon to make 100 trades in a month, break-even, but wind up having paid over a thousand dollars in fees to your broker.

Once you have decided - Deposit enough money that it allows you to *Paper trade* with *Real Time* data.  Over time, as you progress, you will want to make sure you qualify to have a margin-enabled account, trade Options at the highest level, and trade Futures.

**2)** ***Learn*** \-

Before you make a single trade, you need to learn. **A lot.** *This can take months*. Most brokers offer free online courses for you to take. Do not pass those up - most of these courses, while corny in their production value, are actually *really really good*.  There are also plenty of books out there; *Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets* by John Murphy, *How to Make Money in Stocks* by William O'Neil, *Options as a Strategic Investment* by Lawrence McMillian, *Trading in the Zone* by Mark Douglas (more psychological), etc., and plenty of videos that are purely educational (i.e. they are not trying to sell you something). **Soak up everything.**

This is where you want to use your Paper Trading account. As you learn how to trade, especially Options, try it out using the Paper account set to *Real Time*. It is also important that you not put an unrealistic amount of fake money into this account. Don't start with a million dollars - it should be similar to the actual amount you will be starting with in your real portfolio. At this point you are just trying to get a handle on how to trade the following (and the Wiki has detailed posts on all of these):

**a) Stocks** \-

Fairly basic, learn how to buy and sell stocks (going long and shorting). And while most advanced traders use mental stops, as a beginner you will be using real ones, so also learn how to set them, including OCO brackets.  The difference between the bid and the ask, the liquidity in the equity, ETFs, Inverse ETFs, etc. all of these should be memorized and understood. Most traders just know how to buy a stock and then sell it.  By the time you are done you should know not only *how* to short a stock, but what it *means* to short a stock.

**b) Options** \-

In the Wiki there is a post dedicated to helping you understand Options - make sure you read it:

[Options - Explain it Like I am Five Years Old](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pn1rch/options_trading_explain_it_like_i_am_five_years/)

Most of you are not starting with a lot of capital, which means chances are you will be trading options.  And you will soon find out that Options are *very very dangerous*. It is extremely easy to lose your entire account by playing around with these instruments.  So make sure you learn everything you can about Option trading before you ever spend one dime of real money on a Call or Put. This includes learning the Greeks, understanding how premiums work, what IV does to the price of your Options especially as it pertains to earnings season, and most importantly, how to combine Options to create the best possible method for your trade.

**c) Option Spreads** \-

Correctly using Option spreads is one of the best ways to grow an account. It is also one of the more difficult things to master. So spend a lot of time on these. As you will see there are *many different types of spreads*. I suggest getting most familiar with *Call Debit, Put Debit, Call Credit, Put Credit, Diagonals, Covered Calls,* *Butterflies* and *Poor Mans Covered Calls.*

*The key to trading Options is not just to know* ***how*** *to trade them, but to truly understand the mechanics behind the entire transaction.*

***By the time you are done with this section you should know how to execute any type of trade on your platform.  Since you are paper-trading to learn this, do not worry about winning or losing the trade, just make sure you master executing them.***

***Set goals for yourself where you have to successfully execute various types of trades each day without error.***

**3)** ***Analysis -***

If you have just completed the first two steps then you know **how** to make a trade and even know **what** you are trading, but everything else is most likely still a blur. This is where *Technical Analysis* comes in.

All of short-term trading is based on *Technical Analysis*. Long-term investing is focused primarily on *Fundamental* analysis, but as a short-term trader, 99.5% of the time you really do not care what the fundamentals are behind the company you are trading. If you are holding a position for a few hours or days, it doesn't really matter to you what their P/E ratio is, or how their future outlook was last reported. Hell, many times I do not even know what company I am trading, other than the sector it might be categorized.

**What does matter are the charts**. You need to learn how to read the candlestick patterns, which indicators are useful (and which ones are crap), how to read the market, and of course, how to find the right stocks. Once again, I have recommendations in this sub on what resources you should use for this, but there are many out there. This part of your journey is probably going to be the most difficult to master - in fact, you will continue to learn and get better at it as you go along. Every great trader never stops being a student of analysis, and neither should you.

**Make sure you do not get stuck in Analysis Paralysis!**

**Many traders fall prey to trying out every indicator they hear about thinking it will be the Holy Grail.  THERE IS NO HOLY GRAIL INDICATOR.**

**And do not fall for all the "back-testing" crap either - it will always result in some insanely high win-rate.  Just backing testing a 3/8 EMA Cross (you will learn what this is) alone gives you a win-rate over 80% and if that were true every one of us would be insanely rich by now.**

**In fact, the cleaner your charts, the better.  So learn them (many are in the Wiki), but when it comes to finally trading, K.I.S.S.**

By the time you are done with this step you should be able to analyze the charts of any stock you choose, starting with the identification of Support and Resistance across various time-frames.

Even if you think you know all the basics, it is good to go back and review everything.  Besides there is always something new, especially with these damn kids these days and their new-fangled coding on those Commodore 64's (yeah, I know a lot of you won't get this reference)!

**4)** ***Choose a Journal*** **-**

The three most popular are *Tradersync, Tradervue* and *Edgewonk.* RealDayTrading offers a discount for *TraderSync* ([TraderSync Discount](https://www.tradersync.com/?ref=realdaytrading) ) which is the one I use.  Whichever one you choose, make sure at the end of each day, whether paper trading or real, you upload your trades to the journals.  Take the time to go through each trade, labelling them with your set-up/mistakes, and look at your statistics. You want to focus on your win rate, profit vs. loss (i.e. *Profit Factor*), number of trades per day, the types of trades you do well and the ones you tend to lose when using.

Categories like *Type of Stock (price, market cap level, volume, etc.), Time of Day/Week, Trade size, Type of trade (Long, Short, Option Spread, etc.)* are all important to note and study.

***These first five steps should take you at least six months. Which means that is several months where you have not yet made a single trade using real money. And you will be tempted - particularly as you start seeing trades in your paper account making huge returns. Don't do it.***

**5)** ***Choose a Strategy -***

Now that you have a good understanding of how to trade, and you have a decent amount of data in your online journal to see what is working for you, it is time to choose a strategy. While there are many strategies to choose from there is **one strategy we KNOW is consistently profitable.**

**Are there other strategies out there that work? Of course, but I cannot vouch for them.  I and the other professional traders in this sub can attest to the one that is taught in this sub. It works and it is proven out daily with our trades.**

It also should be noted that no matter what - there is *one strategy you should* ***not*** *use - Scalping.*

*Especially Scalping low-float stocks.* **Scalping** is defined as taking a very short-term trade based on the immediate price-action and exiting that trade with the same criteria.  These trades are typically identified through their huge bursts of volume and rapid price movement, particularly compared to the price of the stock.  One needs to balance the need to have tight stops with the volatility that could easily trigger those stops as well. This method of trading is unfortunately what lures most traders into this field to begin with (countless YouTube videos promising you that you can get rich doing it) and it *seems so easy. Scalping is one of the most difficult strategies one can choose, and should only be done by people who are* ***very*** *experienced.*

**6)** ***Choose a good scanner -***

All this knowledge is not going to help if you cannot find the right stocks. Most brokers comes with decent scanners built into their platforms (although this is where *ThinkorSwim* comes up very short), and there are a number of free scanners available as well (listed in the Wiki). There are also a number of scanners out there that cost money, some of them are very good, others are a waste. Be careful that the scanners you are choosing are not optimized to just find ***scalping*** targets.  Once again, I have ones I recommend in the Wiki, but there are many out there that give you great stocks to trade every day (e.g. [Stockbeep.com](https://Stockbeep.com) is a free scanner that will serve you up some great trades).  Also note that if you are looking to Day Trade than you are scanning on a much shorter time-frame (5-Min) then if you were Swing Trading. Your strategy (step 5) will determine the settings on your scanner. Most people will tell you to look for huge jumps in volume, which is always an important factor, but that mainly applies to *Momentum Trading*, which you should be avoiding. At a bare minimum, you do want stocks that have high Relative Volume, but you also want stocks that are strong/weak to the market, have great daily charts, have high liquidity, and have some sort of "buy" signal (whether it is a 3/8 cross on the EMA's, or a breach of consolidation, breaking through *resistance/support,* there are many different scenarios that qualify here). These scanners should also help you create *Watchlists.*

***Most importantly you need to learn how to set alerts on your charts.  Whenever you go through a chart, you should place alert lines on it at areas you want to be notified if breached.***

If you learn how to correctly set alerts you will be given great potential trades every day day by your own platform.

**7)** ***Decide on a Community -***

Many people prefer to trade alone, excel at it even. For me it was fine, but I much preferred trading in a good community. However, there are many scams out there. Three years ago, after trying many different groups, I finally found one that worked for me (*OneOption - which, despite the name focuses on Stocks and Options, Day Trading & Swing Trading*). It improved my trading dramatically. So if you are going to join something, make sure you choose a service that:

**a)** is not focused solely or mainly on *Momentum/Scalping trading*. Most of them will revolve on exactly that - for example, *Warrior Trading* is a scalping group.  Ross, the trader that owns and run the community is without a doubt one of the best *scalpers* in the world - **but** he is well aware that very few people will actually be able to achieve consistent profitable with his method.

**Instead, you want a community that teaches a full 360 approach to trading.**

**b)** has pros in it. People that actually do this for a living. And make sure they are accessible.  ***This is essential - and I am talking about ACTUAL professional traders.  If someone isn't paying their bills and supporting themselves/families with the profits from their trading - they aren't a professional trader.***

**c)** has a great chat room. ***This part is equally as essential.*** You want to be in a chat room that isn't a free-for-all, but rather focused on trading and led by actual professionals. Chat rooms that are filled with amateurs (like you will find on Discord), throwing out trades all the time, can and will actually hurt your trading.

**d)** is filled with resources. Any community you choose that is worth joining will probably cost you money, so make sure they have useful resources, including scanners, platforms and educational content.

Remember, this is your career - which means some things will cost money in helping you prepare for it. The investments in things like a Trading Journal (I recommend TraderSync - here is a discount link:  [TraderSync Discount](https://www.tradersync.com/?ref=realdaytrading)) , Charting Software (I recommend TC2000), a News service (I recommend TradeXchange, here is a discount link -  [TradeXchange Discount](https://thetradexchange.net/shop/?sld=2) ), community, etc - tend to pay dividends down the line.

**8)** ***Start Trading -***

Now that you have chosen your broker, learned the basics of trading, understand technical analysis, found a really good scanner, used a journal to help you choose which strategies you want to focus on, and decided on whether or not you want to be in a community - you are ready to trade.

***You first goal is to Paper trade and achieve the following:***

***3 Straight Profitable Months with at least 100 trades***

***A Win-Rate of 75% or higher***

***A Profit Factor of 2.0 or higher***

**You should not trade with actual money until you can hit these milestones.  It would be in your interest to make sure you have a diversity of trades in your journal - which means you should be proficient at** ***Call-Debit Spreads, Put-Credit Spreads, Time-Spreads, Calls / Puts, Going Long and Shorting Stock***\*\*.\*\*

**Once you graduate from that step, you can use regular money (make sure your account is enabled with margin, options and futures capabilities) and you will now trade only 1-Share per trade.**

**Again, you need to hit the same goals:**

***3 Straight Profitable Months with at least 100 trades***

***A Win-Rate of 75% or higher***

***A Profit Factor of 2.0 or higher***

This is going to be frustrating and take **a lot** of self-control. You are going to be very tempted to take larger trades, especially when you see other people making money.  Don't do it.

***This is your most crucial step.  It is not only validating your mastery of the strategy, but also your ability to be patient.  TRADE ONLY 1 SHARE AT A TIME!***

Once you hit these goals, and have completed all the other steps, you are now ready to start trading.  This entire process, on average, takes two years.

**9)** ***Set Goals -***

Trading for a living is a business. Treat it like one. Set your monthly goals. While you should not focus on your P&L while trading (meaning you do not exit a trade because you are down or up a certain amount of money, you exit because the analysis tells you to exit) you should focus on it in terms of the salary you need to live off day-to-day. It is important to realize that if you reach your monthly goals on *win rate*, *number of trades a day* and *profit factor*, you will also reach you monthly target as well. Remember the ultimate goal here is that at the end of each month you are going to be taking out the profit (this is your salary), and leaving the base behind. By the time you reach this step you should have a really good idea what type of profit you can expect from your strategy, and base amount in the account.

There are two ways to give yourself a "raise":

**A)** Increase your base amount by a set percentage every six months.  This is what I do.  Every six months I increase the base amount by 15%, which winds up roughly a 32% increase in the base every year.  **Note: You should only be increasing your base amount if you are profitable.**

**B)** Re-invest 25% of any profit overage each month - if you have a profit target of $10,000 a month and you make $14,000 - reinvest $1,000 back into your account.

***As your base amount increases, so should your profit targets.  If you start with $50K and work your way up to $55K, your profit targets should increase by 10%.***

**10)** ***Get an Accountant -***

Some people can do this themselves (I am not one of those people), but you want to make sure you are using the best possible set-up to pay the least amount of taxes. Do you qualify for Day Trader status with the IRS? Are you trading out of an IRA? Are you using an LLC or S-Corp? Since this is going to be your business, make sure you have your financials in order.

**So there you go.**

Why do most people fail at short-term trading? Because they jump in before doing any of these steps. They deposit money, and try to scalp low float gappers, or they try to buy a lot of OTM options on the hot MEME stock. Eventually after losing enough money, they quit.

Not only are they given the wrong information, they have an expectation of becoming profitable right away.  The notion of waiting almost two years before actually trading is an utterly foreign concept to just about anyone entering this space.

That is why most short-term traders lose money.

*And even after you complete* ***all*** *these steps, you should still start* ***small -*** *as it will take time. There are some things only experience will give you.  Whether it is spotting a Bull-Trap or knowing when to exit a losing position, it takes time in the chair to recognize those patterns.*

And finally - you need to know going in that there are people that have gone through all 10-Steps, know trading backwards and forwards, and still fail because of ***mindset*** issues.  That is why such a large portion of the Wiki is dedicated to mindset as it plays such a large role in your success.

I know nobody wants to hear that it will take that long to get good at this, however - ***Trading for a living gives you financial freedom.*** The ability to make money no matter where you are, as long as there is an internet connection. No boss. Just you and the market. **Having that life is worth the time and effort.**

I did several challenges to show you that this can be done, and I posted my trades in real-time every single day for over a year.  Other pros have done the same.  You can see beyond any doubt that this isn't some far-fetched rare occurrence. *It is a learned skill that with time and effort can be obtained.*

You can see trader after trader post their testimonials in this sub - going from being ready to give up all the way to quitting their jobs and becoming full-time traders.

As I mention in the introduction section of the Wiki - the first two years of learning was pure hell for me, both financially and emotionally- because I had ***nobody*** helping me.

I want to spare all of you from that.

***So I urge you - if you are trying to figure out how to get started - or want to turn things around, do this the right way - there are no shortcuts.***

Follow these steps and start your journey.

***Please share this post with anyone that you think needs to read it.***

Best, H.S.
