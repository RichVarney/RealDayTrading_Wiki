Market conditions have changed and this is the day trading mindset you need. **The market is NOT going anywhere!** Here's how I know and here's how I will trade this information.

The 100 point /ES days of 2022 are gone and the market is settling into a tight range. Buyers and sellers are paired off and I can make equally compelling arguments why the market could move higher or lower in the next few months. Traders are searching for information that could change the landscape one way or the other.

In the last two weeks we had Q1 earnings, the FOMC statement, the jobs report and the CPI. This was a "window" where we might have seen sustained directional movement and a breakout. That moment passed and the market is still trapped in a tight range below major horizontal resistance and above the major moving averages.

There are 3 basic patterns that we will see. Unfortunately, the most common one is a light volume "Inside Day" where we are trapped between the high and low of the prior day. You should expect these after a big range (like yesterday) or ahead of a major news release. Monday and Tuesday this week were classic examples and traders were waiting for the CPI. On these days you need to expect horrible market action and choppy mixed candles. The market is not going to help or hinder you so the stock will have to do all of the work. You MUST find stocks with heavy volume and D1 technical breakouts. The good news is that the market is not likely to hurt your positions either. That means you might try trading early in the day if you find the right stock. Look for that steady grind higher and that D1 breakout. Do not chase long green candles that can retrace.  There is no market tailwind during an "Inside Day". Ahead of a major news release, if your intent is to day trade and NOT to take overnight risk into the news, you need to error on the side of not trading. Your entries need to be perfect (buy dips and pauses) and you need to wait for your opportunities to set up. Enter poorly and you will take a loss or hold overnight and increase your risk into an event. Look for stocks that are on a mission and that are oblivious to the market. Trim your size and your trade count and focus on a handful of stocks (the best of the best).

The second kind of day is the gradual  drift higher/lower on light volume. The market is able to test the prior day's high or prior day's low and get through that level early in the day. The price action will be OK, but there will be mixed candles and retracement. On the initial breakout to a new high of the day, don't bite on the first candle through. Remember, your mindset is that the market is NOT going anywhere. You need proof. If you see a bearish engulfing candle after a new high of the day, you should be preparing for a reversal. If that breakout holds for a few bars and it starts gaining traction, the move is likely to hold. The volume is light so your mind is going to tell you to be cautious. These moves often have tiny bodied candles of a single color and much of this is program driven. On a bullish breakout, sellers will never be too far away and that keeps these candles tiny. As long as the retracements are minor (no long red candles) and the market stays near the high of the day, it will continue to float higher. When there are signs of selling and it looks like the market is going to roll over, you can expect a bear trap. Short sellers will recognize the light volume wimpy rally and they will be looking for an opportunity to short. A move down to the VWAP would be a classic trap. That dip attracts short sellers and a bounce forces them to cover. When they do so, the shorts cover and the market stages the next leg higher. At some point late in the day, sellers will get more aggressive and they will keep a lid on the move. Day traders who are long will take gains. The chart below is from last week and it provides a good example. The early gap up is going to attract sellers. Remember, no one expects the market to do anything and buyers and sellers are paired off. A big gap up is going to be faded. In this instance the overnight catalyst was good enough to fend off sellers. When the market was able to advance in an orderly fashion and when sellers were not able to knock it down, it was a sign that buyers were in control. The retracement was minor and eventually a bear trap surfaced mid-day when the VWAP was tested. Notice how that test gave the appearance that the market could roll over? That is what attracts short sellers and it makes the trap more effective. As long as you do not see long red candles or a bearish engulf/bearish hammer off of the high of the day, there is no threat to your positions. You should be in the strongest of the strong stocks anyway and they will hold up well.

Very quick note on "Gap and Go" vs "Gap Reversals". Gap Reversals provide much better odds. In a gap up during a sideways market sellers will be anxious. When the open of the first M5 bar fails, that is the first crack in the dam. That reversal has plenty of room to gain momentum and programs feed on momentum. On the other hand, the initial gap up consumes most of the upside potential. Any advance from that point on will be limited. We also run the risk of having the rug pulled out in the first hour and that increases the risk profile for buying a bullish Gap and Go . Know that Gap Reversals are preferred over Gap and Go's for this reason. That means on a Gap Up, your searches should start with bearish candidates. That is where you stand to make the most money. It doesn't mean you will get a reversal, but why not prepare for your most lucrative scenario? If the gap up gains traction you need proof and that time will give you an opportunity to find the best longs. The reversals happen quickly so you need to be ready. Weak stocks that are tanking during a gap up will also be easier to spot because they have relative weakness.

The third pattern to watch for is heavy volume with long mixed candles. This is a sign of volatility and both sides are active. There is overnight news and both sides view the release differently. As good as the move in either direction looks during a high volume day, know that it is temporary. The heavy volume bullish and bearish trend days of old are gone. When we do finally get that big move, the news driving the market will be undeniable. It will be unexpected and it will result in a massive directional move with very little retracement and a breakout above horizontal resistance or below the major MAs. Anything less is going to reverse. This article will help you identify the prevailing patterns to look for, but there is a more important message. Your brain needs to know that THE MARKET IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

Yesterday the CPI came in at 4.9% vs 5%. Big deal. Inflation is still hot and that is inline with expectations. That was the news everyone was waiting for and it was a "nothing burger". The urge to pound the opening gap up was going to be strong. Why? Because the market is not going anywhere. The second bar was a giant bearish engulfing candle well into the gap and that was your cue to favor the short side. The gap filled quickly. The first bounce was big and it retraced substantially (buyers are still active). The volume was excellent so we knew right away that both sides were going to be active and we would get movement. Bears took their shot and here is another moment where this lesson is going to pay off for you. The drop in the middle of the day looked very convincing. Nice organized red candles and the low of  the day failed easily culminating with with a long red candle. This is where your brain needed to kick in. This is NOT going to be like the bearish trend days of 2022. Why not? Because the market is NOT going anywhere! Was the CPI that good or bad? No. Have buyers been active? Yes and we can tell that from the big bounces. Might the new low of the day attract short sellers? Yes. This was a selling climax and because you were in the right mindset you did not add to your shorts. You took gains and you looked for opportunities on the long side. If you do not understand the importance of the previous sentence you will always be wondering, "How do I know when to take profits and when to add? How do I know when to pivot?" It is all about the context that has been set up by the D1 SPY chart.

[We knew from the heavy volume and long mixed candles that buyers and sellers were going to be active. Eventually, buyers would take their shot and we should not expected a market melt-down and a bearish trend day. ](<img src="cache/images/46190f0e4f8d96d3bf05a98e9477737d.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

This is a particularly tough market to trade because it is trapped in a range and the intraday price movement is compressed. Be very suspicious of gaps up or down and know that the tendency will be to reverse that move early (especially if the news is not that material). Trading in the direction of a Gap and Go is risky and you have to make sure that the gap is going to hold. Consecutive tiny bodied candles of a single color on light volume have a tendency to continue (programs). "Inside Days" are very challenging. The market won't help of hinder and you need to focus on a few really strong stocks that have major D1 technical breakouts on heavy volume. When we get heavy volume and long mixed candles, expect nice movement. One side will dominate the early action and then there will be a nice reversal when the other side takes a shot.

The market is trapped in a D1 range and it is not going anywhere. The potential catalyst for a breakout has passed and we are likely to be right here until June. Watch for these days and set up your game plan accordingly. I wrote mainly using bullish price action, but know the same concepts apply to bearish price action. I am market neutral and it was easier to write from one market view point.

I have lots of irons in the fire right now so I have not been able to post much. I hope this article gets you in the right mindset for the summer. Trade well.
