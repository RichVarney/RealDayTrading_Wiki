Hi everyone, thought I would post an update to the on going zone experiment, but it will a short boring post this time.

Hopefully you may find it useful for those that have either done some of the experiment or thinking about doing them.

As you can see, I am still doing the experiments and as of the end of September 2022 I am up to #14.

Original post is here -[https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/wexjc3/trading\_in\_the\_zone\_experiments\_the\_path\_less/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/wexjc3/trading_in_the_zone_experiments_the_path_less/)

***Quick recap -***

1. Setup - hasnt really changed, it can be found in the original post.
2. Position sizing / trade management - main changes to further experiments.

***What I have learned since and in the current market environment -***

**a) Conviction & patience** \- you will need to have confidence to allow your trades to breathe and play out the way you expect.  The market is unforgiving and it changes direction constantly.  You will need to be patient to weather the drawdowns, because there will be.  I am sure you all go through the stress of seeing trades reverse immediately after you take them.  Yes, uncanny.

**b) FOMO** \- this is a constant challenge, and I would venture to say almost all bad trades have some of this aspect to it.  No matter how many experiment trades you do, it is our nature at time to take trades that may have been driven by urges or something else that will inevitably lead to a fail trade or trade mgmt process.  This is real and always hanging over your shoulder.  You will need to master this for the most part to be successful.

**c) Sizing** \- Everyone experiences this.  Inappropriate sizing or sizing up too fast, or moving too quickly from paper trading to real money.  This is all part of the same pot.  This is a long game, sizing up should be slow and systematic but will get you to your destination eventually.  Too fast or inappropriate and you run the risk of blowing your account.  Even more dangerous than blowing your account is, suffering a loss that blows your confidence, because once you do, its all downhill from there and it can take a while to get back.  It will have you questioning or second guess whether you can do this.

**d) PL target** \- This is somewhat tied to sizing but not all the time.  if you have a daily target, be reasonable about it, do not overshoot / overkill.   The stress or urgency in trying to meet an oversized target, will cause you to fail.  This has been mentioned many times by Hari and also in the sub.  Aim for base hits not home runs.  Doesnt seem important but its very true.   If you find that you met that target and thought it was too easy, lets keep going or lets go higher, this will work until it doesnt.  When it doesnt, it doesnt very hard.  Base hits everyday actually equates to several home runs over the course of the month.

**e) Price action** \- This is constantly changing, requires continuous learning.  Keep improving, this is key.

#### Stats time -

I am up to Experiment #14, which is 4 additional (varying sample sizes) since the original post.  Total cumulative stats to date **May - September, 933 trades, 78WR, 2.27PF.**

Overall of **933** trades total, the stats seems ok.  However Z12-14 the individual stats are less than stellar and was performed in the month of September, which for me has been the most challenging month so far.  As such for the my next experiment, I will be sizing down to work out the issues.  This is also apparent in the equity curve below -

FINAL THOUGHTS -

RDT and its teaching works, dont expect a miracle, its success is directly dependent on the effort each member puts in as well.  The more effort, dedication and time invested applying RDT and learning from u/Hseldon2020 and the community, the greater your chances of success.

The post is abrupt as I dont like to write much, but if anyone has any questions, do let me know or send me a message.  I will try to help if I can.
