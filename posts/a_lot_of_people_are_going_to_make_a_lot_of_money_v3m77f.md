*Note - this post speaks to a strategy that is outside the typical purview (short-term trading) of this sub, but it does fall under the very applicable category of "****making money in the market****".*

**In 2020-2022:**

A lot of people got **rich**.

Some got ***wealthy***\*.\*

Others got ***wealthier.***

^(Remember - being Rich means you get a lot of big checks, being Wealthy means you are the one writing those checks)

Money was pretty much raining down during this time and chances are most of you watched it from the sidelines.   While you were holding on to **GME** and **AMC** (hell, throw a little **BB** in there for good measure), others were tripling their net worth.

Those that took advantage of the COVID-induced market crash loaded up on depressed equities and then rode the bullish wave upwards. And now the current market sell-off is the result of those people/Institutions cashing in on those investments.

How often do you look back and kick yourself (repeatedly) for not capitalizing on that situation?

Do you play the "If I just put my money is X, Y and Z back then I would be rich now!" game?

It is a shitty game to play - you always lose it - because it is just a game of regret.

Obviously the crash in Feb/Mar of 2020 was an acute event due to unforeseeable external circumstances, whereas the current market crisis is a far more natural correction into Bearish territory. *But the end result is the same - the market goes into a Bearish trend.*

Now it is useless to debate whether we are in a *Bear* market right now or not - the 20% line in the sand is arbitrary - a definition for headlines, that's all.  What *does matter* is that we are clearly in a *Bearish* trend.  Even with the recent "rally", it does not change the overall calculus.  In fact, some of the most Bullish single days in the history of the market occurred during *Bearish Trends.*  Basically, this little pop in **SPY** means Jack shit.

However, when thinking about a *Bearish Trend* or a *Bear Market* there is something that has been true since the inception of markets themselves - *Bear Markets/Trends do not last long*. In fact, on average most do not even last a year.

Why?

Because it is in the nature of the Market to go up.  Bullish behavior begets bullish behavior and stocks rise until they are well beyond their actual value.  At that point the air is let out until they hit a price level that is once again desirable.  And since it faster to deflate something than inflate it, Markets drop quickly and it does not take much time to hit a level that once again entices Bullish behavior.

All of this is to say that at some point - perhaps this summer, maybe before the end of the year, or in the first half of 2023, but *at some point* \- the market will once again be in a *Bullish Trend*. Will it be as ridiculous as the previous Bull Market? Probably not - but one thing is for certain - when it starts it will be *violent.*  As if the dam breaks and all that money sitting on the sidelines right now pours out into equities.

The questions are - *Will you be ready when it does?* Or will you be sitting there in late 2023 playing that game of regret again?

So how do you get "ready"? And how do you know when you should go from being "ready" to being "active"?

***Let's start with getting "ready"***

I can only tell you what I do - and while I profess expertise in the area of short-term trading and feel comfortable teaching that skill from a position of subject matter authority - I am by no means an expert at *Long Term Investing*.  However, since this "method" combines both, I hope it has some value to you - as long as you realize it is caveated.

The first thing I do is going through every sector and identify the top 5 stocks from each (and everything I am about to describe, my wife also does and then we compare the results).

How do I decide on the top 5 stocks?

I use the following Fundamental Indicators - **Trailing P/E Ratio, Trailing P/E Ratio compared to Sector Average, Forward P/E Ratio, Forward P/E Ratio compared to Sector Average, PEG Ratio, PEG Ratio compared to Sector average, Price to Book Ratio, Price to Book Ratio compared to Sector Average, Average of P/E Trailing / P/E Forward. PEG and Price to Book Ratio Difference to Sector, Fair Market Value vs. Current Price, Fair Market Value vs. Current Price, Morningstar Fair Market Value vs. Current Price,  1yr Consensus Target vs. Current Price,** ***Overall Average Difference in Price***\*,\* **Morningstar Rating (1 through 5 stars).**

And the following Technical Indicators: **Short/Mid/Long Term Outlook (e.g. Bullish/Bearish/Bullish), Current Levels of Support/Resistance in relation to current price, Current trend and any significant technical events (e.g. Stock just broke through the Downward Sloping Algo line to the upside).**

And I decide which  Instrument I would use on the stock when trading it: **Fig Leafs, Straight LEAPS, Selling Puts, Buying Stock**

Thus a stock would look like this:

**CLF:**

*Trailing* *P/E Ratio -* ***3.18***

*Sector Average Trailing P/E Ratio:* ***10.06***

*Indexed Difference:* ***317%***

*Forward P/E Ratio:* ***3.43***

*Sector Average Forward P/E Ratio:* ***12.05***

*Indexed Difference:* ***351%***

*PEG Ratio:* ***N/A***

*PEG* *Ratio:* ***N/A***

*Price to Book Ratio:* ***1.79***

*Sector Average Price to Book Ratio:* ***2.16***

*Indexed Difference:* ***120%***

*Average Difference for P/E, PEG and P/B:* **263%**

*Fair Market Value vs Current Price: $52.66 vs. $23.55*

*Indexed Difference:* ***124%***

*Morningstar Value vs Current Price: $29.4 vs. $23.55*

*Indexed Difference:* ***24.8%***

*One-Year Target vs. Current Price: $32.76 vs. $23.55*

*Indexed Difference:* ***39.11%***

*Overall Average Difference in Price*\*\*: 62.5%\*\*

*Morningstar Rating:* ***3 Stars***

*Short-Term Outlook:* ***Bullish***

*Mid-Term Outlook:* ***Bearish***

*Long-Term Outlook:* ***Bullish***

*Support*\*\*\*: $23.13\*\*\*

*Resistance*\*\*\*: $23.64, $24.31\*\*\*

*Technical Events*\*\*\*: Between SMA 200 and SMA 100, Failing to stay above Horizontal Resistance\*\*\*

*Instrument Recommended:* ***Due to low volatility and low price, I would recommend Buying the Stock if I was to trade it at all.***

I would then rank the various attributes by their level of importance. Once again, this is subjective - some may feel the trailing P/E has no value,  while others can proclaim it is a very important indicator on a companies overall health.

Doing this gives me the top five in each sector.  For example, based on the measures I chose and how I weight their importance (and no, I am not going to say I how weight these measures, everyone needs to figure out what matters to them) stock like **VALE** and **X** are in the top five for *Basic Materials.*

At this point I compare my list with my wife's and we narrow it down to the top 2.  Usually if a stock doesn't match up (i.e. I have it on my list and she doesn't have it on hers) it gets tossed unless the person that has it on their list can make a good argument to keep it.

Once we have the 22 Stocks, they are ranked by each of us and then the rankings are once again compared to one another.   At the end of that process we have a single list of 22 stocks ranked.

*It is always good to do this with someone, and thankfully we have an entire community here, so finding someone to partner with (even finding several people) helps a great deal and improves your level of certainty.*

Separate from this process we make sure there is a clear budget in place - such that (in a very simple way):

**Stocks: 40%**

**Leaps: 25%**

**Selling Puts: 25%**

**Selling Calls: 10%**

**(this is an example - not actual)**

The final part of the process is to identify the instrument for each stock - for example if **FB** would be on that list of 22 stocks and the **Fig Leaf** strategy was to be used for it, it would look like this:

**FB:**

**June 16, 2023 Calls: $175 Strike**

**$50.50 ($5,050)**

**Number of LEAPS: 10**

**Average Weekly OTM (Delta <.10) Call Price: .55 ($55)**

**Expected Covered Call Revenue per Week: $550**

Ok - so now you know how I would do this - now comes the bigger question of *When?*

None of the above matters if you time your entry incorrectly.

If you enter too early you can get absolutely crushed by the rapid decline that follows.  Imagine on March 28th you have just seen the market go up for two straight weeks.  **SPY** went from $415 to $456 during that time and by 3/28 you couldn't stand waiting anymore.   With serious FOMO, you jump buying LEAPS, selling Puts, etc.   What would have happened?

*Within less than a months time you would have been wiped out.*

But you also don't want to enter too late either - because you could miss a large portion of the Bullish move if you sit on your hands for too long.

***Here's the first thing to know - It is ALWAYS better to be late than to be early.***

If you enter the rebound late the worst that happens is you make less money, but if you enter too early the worst thing that could happen is you *lose* all your money.

Have a checklist, but keep in mind that this list must be flexible with context always taking precedent.

**Has there been a material change in the socio-economic conditions?** *For example - Inflation starts to decline, Unemployment Increases along with GDP numbers, the war in the Ukraine reaches a peace agreement, etc.*

**Has there been a significant breach of Technical Resistance on SPY?** *For example, SPY closes above the SMA 50 for the first time since April and remains there.*

**Has Earnings Season Passed with a Higher or Equal number of Exceeds?** *For example companies this Earnings season have, on average, exceeded expectations by 4.7% - how does that compare with the previous one?*

And then you want to make sure the stocks you have chosen participated in the market rally as well -

**Does the stock have Relative Strength to SPY?**

**Has the stock broke through any technical points of Resistance?**

**Is the stock trading with high levels of Relative Volume?**

**Has there been any significant news event since you chose the stock?**

These represents some main items on either list that you might want to know before deciding to start investing but each person's comfort level is different and as such your lists should be adjusted accordingly.

***Also remember - this is not short-term trading and as such your standards need to change.***

It is not uncommon for a **LEAP** call to suffer a significant drawdown as you are selling calls against it, when you sell the **Puts** you are actually *hoping* to get assigned, when you **buy the stock** you are deciding to sell calls against it on one week, but not the other.

And for every position, even though they are *Long-Term*, you have to have a mental stop in place.  Let's say you bought that LEAP on **FB** when the stock was at $235, you might want the use the SMA 50 as your stop to cut your losses (which would be mitigates by the sold calls) on the LEAP.

You might also want to have a target in place - let's say after 6 months, you have managed to generate $1,300 off selling calls on the **FB** LEAP, which reduces your exposure on the option to $3,750, the call is now worth $8,400 - meaning your overall profit from the *Fig Leaf* is $4,650 exceeding your target of $4,500.  At that point you close the position.

In terms of the stocks you own you always need to decide how long you are holding them - some might be for years while others you may decide to cut lose earlier.

Anyway - this is how I plan to take advantage of the market turnaround when it occurs - hopefully it helps you with your plans.

Best, H.S.
