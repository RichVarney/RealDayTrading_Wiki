To begin with - if you have over $25,000 in your Margin enabled account, and you are a Pattern Day Trader (**PDT**) you are given **Day Trading Buying Power** (DTBP) which is a four times multiple on your **Option Buying Power** (OBP).  Your *OBP* is pretty much your capital.  So if you have $40,000 in your account, your *OBP* is $40K and your *DTBP* is $160,000.

Next thing to know is that there are marginable and non-marginable assets you can trade.  Margin is essentially a loan from your broker.

Options are **not-marginable**.  What that means is that you need to have the cash available to purchase them. There are also some stocks, which due to their volatility or float that are also non-marginable.  For example - **TSLA** is a non-marginable stock, but you can use your DTBP on it. However, if you are *Selling Options* you can use margin, but not in the same way you would use it to buy stocks (each broker is different on how much margin they require for non-cash secured option sales).

So for example if I were to have $40,000 in *OBP* and $160,000 in *DTBP* and decided to buy 500 shares of **AAPL** at $140, that would $70K.  I would have $90,000 remaining in *DTBP*, and I would have about $5,000 remaining in *OBP* (because margin would cover 50% of the trade).  But if I decide to buy 100 shares of **TSLA** at $700, I would have a negative *OBP* because the entire $40,000 would need to be used, even though I would still have $90,000 in *DTBP* left.    It can get very complicated, and sometimes it isn't even correct (I have had to call Ameritrade many times to fix miscalculated amounts)

The main thing to know is - if your *OBP* is negative at the close of the day you will be in a margin call the next morning, so always watch out for this.  Also, your *DTBP* for the next day is calculated off your *OBP* at the close of trading (depending on the broker this can be as late as 8pm est) - which means even if in the morning you close your positions and restore your *OBP*, you will have no *DTBP* to use (as it is 4X the *OBP* at the close of the day).

There are far more complex calculations that go into it, but suffice to say one of the good things about the *PDT* rules (among all the bad crap) is *Day Trading Buying Power*. This works like an intra-day loan allowing you to have position sizes far larger than you would otherwise be able to obtain.  Without *DTBP* it would be very difficult to Day Trade anything other than Options.

Ok - so back to the original question - *How Much?*  First let's get something out of the way - even if you used the entire $160,000 in a trade (i.e. 1,000 shares of a $160 stock) ***you are not risking $160,000***.  Unless you think there is a chance that a $160 stock suddenly goes to $0 in the blink of an eye, you are *only risking what you decide to lose.*

If I go long 1,000 shares of a $160 stock, but my stop (mental or hard) is at $159 - my risk in that trade is $1,000.  However, there are some issues that can arise, far more often than you might think. As I have said many times, the "rules" of trading provide a foundation, but when in the heat of battle, context is everything.  Here are some issues that come up when you have used *all* your *DTBP* on a trade:

**A)** Let's say you start out the trade with a stop of $159, but because of changing conditions (i.e. increased volatility) you may decide to expand that stop out to $158 - however, since your position size is 1,000, you are not willing to lose $2,000.  At this point you are making a decision based on your P&L and not your analysis.

**B)** You chose the $160 stock partly because you liked the daily chart and felt that based on the market/stock you could swing if it temporarily turned against you.  Although now, due to the size of your position, swinging the stock poses a much larger risk (e.g. the market goes down on news overnight), a risk you might not be willing to take.  Additionally, swinging a stock when you have used all your *DTBP*, leaves you with no *OBP,* which as noted above, means your *DTBP* the following day will be negligible.

**C)** You are in the trade but the stock is moving slowly - grinding up.  Suddenly an alert goes off on a $25 stock, and you notice it has broken through several lines of significant resistance.  A perfect set-up, except there is one problem - you have no buying power left to use.  So now you have to decide whether or not to prematurely exit your current position and jump into the new trade, cut your position size, or just ignore the alert.

In other words, when you use all your *DTBP* on a single trade you can start making decisions based on your P&L and not the analysis.

Those caveats aside, there are is so much attention paid to *position sizing* that I feel traders sometimes miss the forest for the trees (so to speak).  Let's look at this another way - you have $50,000 (and thus, $200,000 in *Day Trading Buying Power*) and your daily goal is to make $1,000 a day.  Put aside for a moment whether or not that goal is reasonable, because there are arguments on both sides of that debate.

With a goal of 2% a day in profit, your sample size would need to be much larger than if your goal was $250 a day (.5%).   And this is where your trading journal comes into play, particularly three measures:

*Win-Rate, Profit Per Trade, Average Trades Per Day*

If you had a win rate of 80% and you made 10 trades a day, in order to make $1,000 you would need to make $150 per win and $100 per loss.  If you are trading a $160 stock, and you feel you can get 50 cents profit from the trade, you would need a position size of 300 shares ($48,000).  You also can't lose (on average) more than 33 cents per trade.

One way to reduce the position size here is to increase your average number of trades per day.  If for example you made 20 trades per day, you would need to make $75 in profit (losing only $50 per trade).  In that example, your position size would go to 150, not 300.

Another way to reduce the position with this goal in mind would be to increase your win rate. If it were 90% and you average 10 trades per day, you would need to make $125 per trade (and can lose $125 as well) and a position size of 250 is needed.  If it were 90% and you average 20 trades per day, you would need to make $62.50 in profit per trade, and your position size goes down to 125.

However, let's say a deeper examination of your trading stats show that for 90% of your wins you average $100 in profit, but for 10% of them you average $500 in profit.  Now you need to look at the set-ups and see which set-ups are most common with the larger wins (generally momentum-based trades), and also note if those set-ups carry a higher potential loss as well.

Then you need to consider the market itself as it a *huge* factor.  Remember the third caveat above? Where a really good trade comes along but all of your buying power is tied up?  On some days it seems the market is trending so strongly that one good trade after another is coming in your direction.  On days like that you want to have the flexibility to jump into a good trade with the right position size.  Other times the market is so dead that finding a good trade is like finding a needle in a haystack (I imagine needles would be pretty easy to find in haystacks but whatever....) and on those days you want to capitalize on a rare good trade when you see it.

Finally, your *mindset*.  If you take 2,000 shares of **SIGA** are you prepared for the volatility?  If you got in at $11.50 and the technical stop is $10.50, are you going to freak out if it drops to $11 and you are down $1,000?  Are you prepared to close the trade if it hits the stop and take a $2,000 loss?

All of this information combines with the size of your account to inform how large or small of a position you should take in a trade.

So to recap, how much *buying power* to use to size your positions need to consider:

**A)** Your goals - is it a daily goal? Weekly?  How aggressive is it compared to your total account.  This will define your level of risk tolerance.

**B)** Your account size - will you have buying power left? Are you risking having negative *OBP*?

**C)** Your stats - how likely are you to be profitable in the trade? How many trades do you make? What is your average profit? Average loss? What type of set-up are you trading?

**D)** The stock itself - is it moving on momentum, a slow grinder (there is something euphemistic about that....), volatile, are the natural stops wide or narrow?

**E)** The market - are you in a high probability trading environment? Is it all chop?

**F)** Can you handle the potential drawdown and stay with the position if it hasn't violated your initial trade thesis?

As usual, all of these factors combine to form the context for the trade - and there is no "set rule" about using a certain percent of your *buying power* for a trade.

Best, H.S.
