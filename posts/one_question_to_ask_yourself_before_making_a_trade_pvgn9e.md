***"Can I Defend This Trade?"***

Seems like a very basic question, right?  If another trader asked you why you took the trade, can you defend your position?

If your defense is not based in any form of analysis, the answer is - no.

So many traders lose money consistently because they are constantly trying to anticipate a move before waiting for confirmation.  Guessing at bottoms and tops, attempting to 'stay ahead of the market', and wanting to capture a move from the very beginning are some of the top reasons why new traders wind up in the red.  Asking yourself this question before making a trade will help you filter out these *gut* decisions.

Let's say you bought calls on **ZM** at the close of market on Friday, and when asked why, your answer is, "I think it has hit bottom, it has to start reversing soon" - *that is not a defense.*

Or perhaps you bought puts on **CRM** at the close of market on Friday, with the defense of, "It think it will pullback on Monday" - *once again, that is not a defense.*

**Defensible trades are ones that you can offer clear analysis that support your decision.**

It doesn't mean your trade will work, but it does mean that you had understandable reasons for the making the play you did.

For example - on Friday I made the following trade, which I am still holding:

Put Debit Spread, expiring on 10/1 for **AMZN** where I bought the 3400 Puts and sold the 3350 Puts.  This costs me a debit of $16.25.

Here is my defense -

1. I am getting a 68% ROI on this trade, with $33.75 per contract of upside - meaning, if I am right more than 35% of the time, this trade is profitable.
2. **AMZN** has been weak to the market on a daily basis.  **SPY** has filled the gap from its' drop on 9/20, while **AMZN** has not.
3. **AMZN** is struggling to stay above its' SMA 50 right now, with low volume these past three days (compared to the high Relative Volume when it dropped).
4. My bias on the market is somewhat bearish - while **SPY** has filled the gap, selling pressure remains strong and it has not been able to rebound as previous patterns on the ETF suggested it might.
5. The rest of my portfolio is somewhat bullish, and given my slight bearish bias on the market, the **AMZN** trade acts as a strong hedge for me as well.
6. If **AMZN** manages to say above it's SMA 50 I still have some time close the trade for a loss, but not max loss.

Admittedly this is a riskier trade than what I usually do - but it is still *defensible.*

There are also many arguments *against* this trade as well - **AMZN** has shown a HA reversal on the daily chart, it closed above its' SMA 50, with an ATR of 60 it could move up significantly on Monday and thus leaving me with little chance to close the trade without taking a huge loss.  Just because there are arguments against a trade, does not mean it is not *defensible*.

Go through your trades in the past week/month and ask yourself, could I have defended this trade?  Be honest about it, and just mark the trades you could have defended with a Y and the ones you couldn't with a N.  Now look at the profit/loss for the trades marked with a Y vs. those with a N.  I absolutely guarantee that you performed significantly better on the trades you could defend.

While there are many different things one should do in order to be a successful trader, just asking yourself this question before making a trade will save you a significant amount of losing positions.  It is a very simple litmus test, and quick to apply.

Best - H.S.
