This is a tough market, so let's simplify it and start with these four simple rules and leave the exceptions to these rules to those with more experience: 

**Rule 1:** If the market is down - **No Longs** \- no matter how good they look, only Relatively Weak Shorts, If the Market is Up - **No Shorts**, no matter how weak they look, only Relative Strength Longs, If the Market is Undecided, **No Trade**.  

**Rule 2:** Do not short a stock Above VWAP on the M5, and Do not go long on a Stock Below VWAP on the M5.

**Rule 3:** Do not go Long or Short unless a Stock has an HA Continuation of at least 2 Days on the Daily Chart  
**Rule 4:** Do not go Long unless the stock is above all major SMA's on the Daily, Do not go short unless it is below all major SMA's on the Daily  
And before you do it go back to your last month or two of trades - and code them - 

*1 Rule Checked, 2 Rules Checked, 3 Rules Checked, or All 4 Rules Checked.*  

Then Look at your win-rate and profit on each category - You will see your win-rate and profit increases the more checks you have. 

Best,

H.S.
