I trade a lot of Heiken Ashe reversal setups with great success (currently over 95% win rate).  The reversal is identified after the current HA candle closes (on whatever time frame you are using  I use 5 min generally) 

Once you have a valid HA reversal the first thing that needs to be true is that the HA candle height has to be at least as large (preferably larger) than the prior candles that occurred prior to the reversal. You dont want to be entering a reversal trade on a small HA reversal candle after several much larger candles that occurred prior. If that is the case you need to wait for at least one more HA candle that is bullish (flat bottom) or bearish (flat top) that corresponds to the direction of your trade.

Then check for any nearby support or resistance levels that may limit your potential gains.

Next, the trade should be taken in the direction of the current market trend for maximum probability of success.

The trade should also be on a stock with relative strength or relative weakness (if trading indexes stick with trading with the market trend .

Another key element is the bollinger bandwidth should be expanding (indicating a move out of compression)

My final criteria, which is critical, is assuring that institutional traders are supporting the reversal. I use the Right Line Compass system indicators for this since it is so accurate at identifying institutions being in the trade.  (full disclosure I run an options trading room for Right Line using the Compass System which i started after using the Compass System for 6 months to determine its effectiveness)

The last step is after you are in the trade switch to standard candles since you will be able to identify when momentum is waning more quickly using regular candles.

I think you will find trading HA reversals will be a very profitable strategy if done correctly
