I ran into a few issues analyzing my trades that trade logging software just couldn't do well for me:

1 - some broker platforms don't let you paper trade AND live trade at the same time, so you need to pick one. What do you do if you are live trading 1 share/super small size but you want to include trades using contracts that are big $$$?  I'll take the 5 META shares but I'm not touching a 14$ COST contract with a 10 foot pole right now.

2 - walkaway analysis just sucks on most software. In real life some trades you hold longer, some you take profits sooner. I wanted to be able to see the stats on if I held a trade waiting for another push into more profits or took profits at the previous opportunity, which means my walkway needed to be more discretionary. I wanted to imagine how I would typically manage the TA on a trade if my expectations were different.

3 - I wanted to see what this looks like visually. Am I improving over time to my walkways? where during the timeline of SPY did I suck vs did good? What parts of SPY worked better with various scenarios? When was nimble better? When was patient?

4 - I wanted to know how much of my messups was mindset, criteria, or exit discretion. As I'm learning, pretty much *everything sucks* but what sucks the MOST? That's where you get the best improvements. Right now it's 3-5 times where I gave too much time for a short to work, and not enough time for a long to come back. This last season if I gave my longs a little more leash and my shorts less leash my profit factor would be almost 50% higher.

So I made my own sheet that shows me everything with 4 alternate scenarios. I'm only using two right now: Nimble and Patient. What would my trading look like if I took profits at the previous opportunity, or waiting for the next opportunity? It's not perfect and but it gives me a good idea of my discretion to hold or take profits.

**What it does:**

You can adjust all of your profits for R to see what your performance is like with a standardized % gain or lot size or # risk. up to you. This lets you paper trade and trade super small size but still get good feedback.

It shows you your rolling win rate and profit factor so you can see periods of good and bad performance.

You can see the impact on your profit factor, and profit in R for each individual trade.

You can see how wild/volatile your P/L is. You need to get it tight enough so that you have a smooth income.

You can see this all visually on a chart too and highlight each point to see what trade did what to your overall stats. For example I can see how reversing my $ABNB long absolutely decimated me and how it caused a serious struggle the rest of the month. It helps a ton to see how to align your expectations with the market.

**What this doesn't do:**

It doesn't fix your issue if it's mindset related or setup/criteria related. For mindset issues your tags will tell you what you did wrong, and then you'll need to address the underlying emotional issue. For setup/criteria issues you need to use your trade log tags and find similarities and correlations etc. . If you are taking crap trades it wont help you. If you aren't believing in your picks it wont help you. If you can't take a loss it wont help you

[Here's the sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P_Fdxx-7SqEgnhBbk4UtIAW1RxBswaHf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101491872730348994828&rtpof=true&sd=true) I've included my results all the scars and warts using the nimble/patient walkaway starting about 1/3 in. You can see visually where each walkaway performs better than the other, and also where big deviations like mindset mistakes take a chunk out of my progress. Some of you guys are posting absolutely insane trade logs and mine does not look like that but I try to just lay it all out there including all of my entries and exits live and focus on where I'm at personally.

IF YOU ARE NOT INTERMEDIATE YET, YOU SHOULD USE THE BASIC 15m/60m/eod etc walkaway. This builds faith in your picks.

*You can also see how taking profits faster AND being more patient are* ***both*** *more profitable. Things wont actually play out this perfectly in real life but that tells me that most of my picks are reasonable, and it's primarily my mindset that wrecks my ability to align better with the market*

I have one of these for every type of setup. Traditional RS/RW, Lottos, Momos, WATM, credit spreads etc. And then they are linked to a master composite sheet that tells me overall how I am doing with my stats. This tells me which strategies I can lean into more and which ones need to be overhauled.
