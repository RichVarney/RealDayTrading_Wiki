Let me start off by saying **I hate Strangles**.  I am a directional trader and by their nature Strangles are essentially your way of saying, "I know it is going to move, but I have no fucking clue which way it will go!"

Well - tomorrow the CPI number comes out - so we know **SPY** is going to move, which just have no idea in which direction it will head.  

Now you could look at the *very atypical* price action today with confusion, and rightfully so - usually the market tends to stay in a consolidated state of low volume chop before the release of a significant economic indicator.  Most traders associate this with the release of the FOMC, as the period before that is sometimes referred to as being "*Dead until the Fed*".

Basically Asset Managers do not want to commit to any direction until they know what they are dealing with on a macro level.  

Tomorrow we have the release of the CPI which is the primary indicator being used to gauge whether *Inflation* is continuing, pausing or declining.  The market has priced in the notion that by now *Inflation* would have at least peaked - meaning that while the number might still be high, it is roughly the same as the previous month.  If the CPI shows *Inflation* going up that would have Institutions making the following assumptions:

**1)** The Fed will be even more aggressive with their policies - which could remove the hoped for *soft-landing* and result in....

**2)** A higher probability of a Recession

The market doesn't like Recessions (and neither do we!) and if the CPI comes in hot, you could see **SPY** sink well below 400.

However, if the CPI shows a decline in Inflation that would alleviate pressure on the FED and push them towards more dovish policies.  

The market likes a Dovish FED and if that happens you could see **SPY** head well over 410.

The *atypical* part of today is that Asset Managers *did not wait* for the CPI - they already started pricing in bad news.  This anticipatory selling is unusual.  Imagine having a million shares of **FB** (or **META** which just sounds weird) at $186 and you decide to sell them today.  Why would you do that? Obviously because you think tomorrow they are going to be much lower.   

So how would you play this?

Well - you could get OTM Calls on SPY @ $412 for .32 and OTM Puts on SPY @$392 for .32

Let's say you got 10 each, so $320 for the Calls and $320 for the Puts

Tomorrow the CPI comes in high and **SPY** drops down sharply on the open to $397.  The first thing you do is sell those Calls for about .03, meaning you lost $290.  Now all you need to do is sell the Puts for more than .61 to make a profit.  With **SPY** at $397 those puts would most likely be worth around $1.10, meaning you made .49 profit on the trade.  And of course the reverse applies if **SPY** gaps up tomorrow.

I will rarely suggest trades like this - but in these scenarios those are the types of strategies you should consider (obviously it is too late for this time, but to keep in mind for the next one).

Best, H.S.
