As I'm still an intermediate, I don't get too bunched up about making mistakes anymore so long as I don't make them over and over, and that I learn heavily from them.

Here's some conclusions I made that I've learned, or that I already "knew" but clearly didn't "believe" yet

#### Mistake 1 - Sector Heavy

Last week Thursday there was a full menu of great d1's to short, but the day ended up bouncing. Usually that's no big deal because you have cushion on your stocks with RW/RS. But what happens if your sector bounces even harder than the market?

That's avoidable. I was short AMD, PSTG, and MSFT. All 3 were tech stocks. That means that if the reason why your shorts reverse is the sector, you are effectively **Triple Sized.** Stocks are a safer surrogate for the market direction, but also the sector which subsequently is the surrogate for the market.

I could have easily been short AMD, DOW, and XPEV. 3 separate sectors. That provides much less fragility to your buying power.

**Fix - make sure your buying power isn't heavily weighed in a single sector,**

#### Mistake 2 - Missing Market Context

5' price action can mean different things depending on the context of the last d1 candle. For example, if you see a pop at the open easily get retraced in the next few candles, that's bearish. But what if you still haven't broken yesterdays low? It is much less significant. If you miss details like this you can easily get caught with your pants down

Reading the market is hard because of so many factors like this needing to come together. You need to be aware of exactly where the price is in relation to other prices on SPY, but also where in the grand scheme of things you are. Obviously there's no end to how many things you can look at and paralyze yourself with.   


Here's a checklist that should be comprehensive enough but let you still take action

**Fix -** use  mental checklist of the following criteria for your market conviction:

\-Macro thesis like economic reports, time of year, news etc

\-D1 price action including volume, obv, and major support/resistance points

\-5' price action including volume, previous day's levels, and major support/resistance points

#### Mistake 3 - Confirmation

Obviously this is a no brainer but I can't believe that I broke this cardinal rule on SPY. Entering shorts on 9/1 right when SPY was sitting on support and the upsloping 6/17 algo. Simply waiting for the second break to confirm below the low of the day would have saved me.

**RANT INCOMING:**

Can you argue for this to be okay with a strong macro thesis. YES! And I think that the overall sentiment about it should eventually ring true. In fact, things worked out just fine.

But how long can you hold your positions? Will you lose theta or expiry on your options? The bigger your account, the more big picture you can play. You can absorb the losses, send your shares away to LTI account, sell premium against them etc. But if you're new and have a smaller account that's your nest egg and lifeline to supporting your family and future.... *do you want to work every day in an environment like that? Can you survive that?*

If the answer is yes, then you'll have to get REALLY good. Mentally AND skill wise. **Because you'll have to trade like that all the time.** More risky trading = bigger losses AND bigger winners. You cannot pick and choose. You have chosen the fast lane.

It's like Formula 1. The cars NEED to be driven extremely fast for the tires and brakes to work. It's either balls to the wall or not at all. u/HSeldon2020 is a Formula 1 car.... actually more like a space shuttle. I am a Toyota Corolla.

Will you be able to handle that type of stress chronically? What is your risk of blowing up? Can you be mistake free in that environment?

That's up to you to decide but if you're serious about this being a profession, this isn't a game.

My log tells me that if I get aggressive and trade like this there's a delayed drawdown coming. Better results for a few days, then *more* than equally bad results a few days after that. But if I trade patiently, slowly, and extremely sparingly it's a steady boring stress free profit curve up. Like a Toyota Corolla on cruise control

**Fix -** have levels set on SPY where it's trade/no trade. Understand what level of aggressive is your optimal zone of performance, because you have to ALWAYS trade at that level.

#### Mistake 4 - Thesis Switch Points

Yesterday was a perfect example. Just like you're always keeping a menu of optimal longs AND shorts regardless of your bias, you need a list of conditions where you would trade the OPPOSITE direction of your bias.

Maybe your shorts will be okay and the market is still heading down, but yesterday you probably missed out on some profits going long because you were frozen in anticipation. A break of the previous days high was probably a good idea to take longs but let's face it you probably just stared at your shorts. 

In hindsight, you probably HAD to take longs to absorb some of the incoming losses of shorts that won't be able to make it back down. Hell, maybe even just win more.

But what if the market rug pulls while I'm long? What if my bigger picture thesis happens while my shorter time frame thesis in the opposite direction is on risk? That's personally my biggest mental road block and I have a fix for that:

Trading RS/RW gives you a cushion to exit market reversals. If you were in the right stock, you'll be okay or maybe take a tiny loss. It's not enough to know this. You need to believe this, and beliefs take time and repetition to form.

**Fix**\- have decided in advance, where you would switch your thesis for at least the day, and remember that you are trading positions that are inherently forgiving.

#### Knowing vs Believing

This is my closing point. It's cool to have a ton of knowledge about what you should or shouldn't do but none of this is useful unless you can actually do it. Why is that so god damn hard? Because of your emotions. The difference between knowing and believing is emotional integration.

If you can't regulate your behavior about something, then you don't understand your beliefs surrounding that thing. That's why you can't DO what you KNOW yet.

**When you believe something, you'll adhere to it regardless of the emotional pain**. Trading requires you to break your emotions apart and rebuild them differently. You can't tear it all apart on day 1 and survive the reassembly. The only way to do that is grain by grain with deliberate repetition.

That is why it takes 2 years.
