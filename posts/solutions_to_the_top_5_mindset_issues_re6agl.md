In my last post I outlined the five most common *mindset* issues that traders tend to face ([https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/r9pvgl/top\_five\_mindset\_issues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/r9pvgl/top_five_mindset_issues/)).

In summary, they were:

\- **Gambling**

\- **Uncharmed Life**

\- **Counter-Trend Trading**

\- **Lack of Confidence**

\- **Over-Confidence**

It would be a very rare trader that did not have to deal with at least one of these psychological roadblocks to success.  And while these issues tend to plague *newer* traders more often, and with more intensity, than those with more experience, veterans in this field are not immune.  I continuously fight the *gambling* urge myself, and suspect I will never truly be rid of the desire to just treat the market as one big casino.

The first step is recognizing which issues you have, if any, and how much it impacts your trading overall.

When thinking about how to solve them, it is easier to split them up into two buckets:

**Personality -** this would include *Gambling, Lack of Confidence,* and *Over-Confidence*

**Worldview -** this includes *Counter-Trend Trading* and *Uncharmed Life*

Considering our personalities and worldviews are pretty well set at a certain point in our lives, overcoming problems that stem from either is never an easy task.

While this post will give you tangible solutions to these issues, like just about anything you read it falls under the category of "*easier said than done*".  Your ability to implement these rests on how seriously you take the issue and how much effort you put into solving it.

So let's dive in to the first one:

***Gambling*** \- Gamblers are a very different breed of people from everyone else and unless you are one, it is very difficult to understand the mentality.  It is ingrained into a person's *personality.* The drive to gamble is an irrational one.  I am a Statistician (or at least I used to be, I am sure today's Statisticians can run circles around me) and I know full well what the odds are for every single casino game and how they are stacked against me.  Doesn't matter.  I know the more I play those games, the more likely it is I will lose money.  Doesn't matter.  I also know that if I get lucky enough to win, I should take that money and run.  Doesn't matter - I don't.  Gambling is a form of self-sabotage that has nothing to do with rationality.   We might convince ourselves that we are playing to win, but in reality *we are playing to lose*...in every gambler is a deep, dark desire to hit rock bottom.  *That* is what you must deal with when you apply this mentality to trading.  The idea of *hitting singles*, and *small gains* is foreign to the gambler, especially after a big loss when they just want to try to "win" it all back. You're never going to replace the thrill of a win or the soul-crushing depression of a loss.  The dopamine hits after each gamble is like heroin to the gambler, and trying to explain the virtue of consistent/steady gains is like trying to tell a teenager that a nice cup of tea by the fire is better than going out with their friends to a party.   **Solution:** I have learned one very simple trick though - **stop trying to justify it and just call it what it is - Gambling**.  "Why did you get all those OTM calls on **TSLA**?" - the answer, "Because I am ***gambling***."  You see gamblers will try to justify their irrationality, they need to have some excuse to make their actions sound reasonable, otherwise they are just a degenerate.  So call it what it is - Gambling.  "Why are you shorting SPY at the all-time high?" - "I'm gambling, that's why." Doesn't sound so good, does it?   Keep your online journal, and label each one of these irrational plays what they are - **Gambling**.  And then at the end of the month add up all the money you lost from - **Gambling**.  And now - here comes the hardest part of this solution - When you have the total amount you lost from Gambling at the end of each month, make a post that says - This Month I Lost $XX Because I Gambled on Stocks.  You won't be able to do it, because you will be too ashamed to publicly acknowledge your issue.  When you stop trying to hide behind ridiculous justification for your actions, it becomes much more difficult to....justify.

***Lack of Confidence*** \- Another *personality* characteristic - because it is an almost certainty that trading is not the only place you lack confidence. You may *project* confidence to others, in fact, you probably do - but between you, me and the candlesticks, you know that you don't have any. It is the constant second guessing yourself, and your trades - "Did I read the chart right? Did I make the right call?"  Saying to yourself, "I'm never going to get this..." more times than you want to admit.  Exiting trades way too early because you lost faith in the set-up.  How do you know if this is you?  Think to all the things you achieved in life, and there may be a few,  how many of them do you credit to yourself and how many do you attribute to something or someone else? If you fall into this category you will find that you probably don't really credit much to yourself.  Most likely if you were successful somewhere you think you "fooled people" into believing you knew what you were doing.  I can only imagine how difficult it must be to live like this, let alone trade like it.  But trading *requires* confidence.  No matter how much knowledge you have, if you do not have confidence in your trades, you will be making your decisions based on *fear* rather than *information*.  Someone with this problem might say it is a catch-22, they need to be successful before they can be confident and they need to be confident before they can be successful.   *But is that true?* Think back in your life - has success given you confidence or, like in the question above, did you simply attribute that success to something other than your own efforts/skills?  You could have an amazing week in the market, but if you fall into this group you will probably just chalk it up to - luck.  The solution to this problem is not easy, nor is it straightforward.  To begin with you can use *external validation -* write a post that details out some of your trades for a day and put it up in the sub asking for feedback.  If your trade was well executed, poorly managed or everything in-between, you will find out pretty quickly.   Because sometimes, *Lack of Confidence* is well-founded.  Meaning, you might actually suck at this and guess, what? *That is important to know!* That doesn't mean you can't improve, but one should know if their doubts are based in reality or self-delusion.   However, the real solution lies back in that trading journal again.  **Solution:** Take one month and be meticulous with every single trade - after each one write down the exact set-up you used and the reason you entered (this also forces you to slow down, which is good), as well as the reason you exited.  Also note the mistakes.   At the end of each day upload these trades to your trading journal and enter in the set-ups & mistakes (try to make sure you keep your labelling consistent).   These can even be from paper trading.  At the end of the month, find the top three set-ups that have the highest win percentage, and then for the next month, *only trade those set-ups*.  Also find the *top two mistakes* and work on fixing them (i.e. exited without a technical reason).  This may reduce your total number of trades, which is fine.  But the most important thing is to *only trade the top three set-ups.*  Continue to enter them into the journal and continue to enter in the mistakes.  At the end of the second month see if the percent of time you commit those mistakes has declined, see if your overall win rate has gone up.  Keep refining this process over and over until you find at least one set-up that returns a 70% or higher win-rate.  Yes, this may take a long time, but you are trying to solve a rather deep issue, and if you don't it will forever remain a roadblock to your success as a trader.  Once you have found a set-up that works, you need to only *trade that set-up* for the next month after that.  P&L is not important here, reducing mistakes and raising your win rate is the only thing that matters.  If you follow those steps, you will find it will dramatically improve your self-confidence over time.

***Over-Confidence*** \- Not so ironically you are very similar to the person who *lacks confidence*, you just came up with a very obnoxious defense mechanism.  As a *personality* characteristic those that fall into this group are usually that one person in your friend group that has to "top everything" someone else says or does.  If they ever bother to ask about someone else's life it is just so they can guide the topic back to themselves in some way.  One of the problems with these people is that they do not really know they have an issue - so here is a little guide: If you think you have come up with some new way to "beat the system" and you are not yet consistently profitable every month - you are in this category.  If you think this is "easy and everyone else are idiots", you are in this category.  If you think you are one "meme stock" away from being rich, you are definitely in this category.  Unfortunately there is very little this person can do themselves - they are in fact far too delusional to even imagine that anything needs to be done.  You would think it should be easy, right? A simple question - "Are you consistently profitable yet?  No...then what the hell are you so cocky about?"  But the truth is, the only way this is overcome is by having very patient teachers/mentors slowly show them how far removed from reality their vision of trading really is, and chances are once they see the truth they will run far away.  **Solution**: There is none, these people are a pain in the ass.  Seriously, if you are in this group, either you stop being an asshole, or you don't.

***Counter-Trend Trading -*** This is a big one, and it is driven by  - *arrogance.*  I'll explain, since I am sure this is not the first descriptor that may come to mind.  Essentially, *counter-trend* trading would be those people going into this current week with **SPY** Puts.  **SPY** just crossed 470, which if you read the post on Market Psychology, was perfectly predicted, and there is *absolutely* nothing that would indicate one should short the market - but *counter-trend traders* believe they can predict *Tops* and *Bottoms*.  Even more infuriating is if the market does happen to go down next week they will quickly brag about how they were right (they tend to stay remarkably quiet all the times they are wrong, which is pretty much most of the time).  They fall into different categories, with most embodying a combination of these:

\- *What Goes Up Must Come Down....* This is the most basic of your *counter-trend* *traders,* they have a very simple philosophy - when something is up **a lot** they short it, and when something is **down a lot** they go long. Pretty straightforward and spectacularly wrong.  Let's look at **NET:**

&#x200B;

<img src="cache/images/fefcf35f45f94e3b0fbae5e2e5c98a3c.png" alt="Reddit Image">

One of just many examples - of how a stock can keep going up....if I showed you the chart for **PTON** or **PYPL** you would see it in the other direction.  And why do they do this?  Greed and arrogance - they don't want to wait for confirmation because then they will have *missed the big move,* plus they also want to be able to tell everyone they "knew it".  A *counter-trend* trader **loves** to tell people how they just *knew* they were right.  There was a good short on **NET**, if they waited for the signal that came on 12/2 with the bearish doji, right after the break of the SMA 50, but by then you already missed the $220 to $170 drop and are only left with the $170 to $140 drop....poor you.   *Our job as retail traders is to wait for Institutions to make their move and then follow the money (i.e. trend).  We* ***confirm*** *we don't* ***anticipate***\*.\*

\- *Anecdotal Analysis -* This form of *Counter-trend* trading has the trader believing that the anecdotal information they see in their daily lives can be applied to a larger trend across the national/worldwide marketplace.  It is really quite extraordinary when you think about it, but the thought process goes a bit like this - "I haven't watched Netflix in a long time, my kids don't watch it and my friends never talk about it.  I used to hear about them all the time, and lately not a peep.  Makes sense with the pandemic waning that less people are using it....I bet it is due for a big drop.  Shorting it!" Which leads to the next, similar, type of thinking....

\- *Common Sense Analysis -* This brilliant form of trading involves a connect-the-dots manner of thinking that so many people excel at, and looks a bit like this: During the pandemic people used their credit cards *a lot*, many people even maxed them out and now that employment is going up they are going to have to start to pay them back, with a lot of interest. The next earnings for **Visa** is going to be through the roof!  Long **Visa!**"

There is a very simple solution to all this - whenever you have one of these thoughts or urges, you need to realize that in order for you to be right, that means you are *ahead* of the *Institutions*.  Why? Because if the *Institutions* has already figured out what you just thought, they would have acted on it and it would be reflected in the price.  For example, if the person above is right about **NFLX**, and the *Institutions* already knew about this prized piece of information, they would have sold their shares - thus, **NFLX** would have already dropped.  **Solution:** Before you act on these epiphanies that showcase your business acumen, imagine the following scenario - A Senior Vice-President at Goldman Sachs, let's call her Debbie, is called into the President's office, and they wants to know why the hell didn't they buy **Visa** before it started going up?  And Debbie, stammering has say...."Well, even though we have hundreds of data scientists, and spend millions upon millions of dollars for consumer data, we just never figured out that people would be paying off that much debt.  I mean, I know Joe, from South Carolina managed to piece it together, but our whole team was stumped!"   Because **that** is what you must think is occurring in order for you to be right.

*Anything you might think of, anything you might guess, if correct, is already baked into the price.  Period.  You are not going to out-think or out-guess these Institutions that spend endless amount of money to figure out the most likely scenarios and then act on them.  If* ***Visa*** *was truly going to have a banner quarter, and Institutions knew it, then guess what? They would be buying* ***Visa!*** *Hence, the price would be going up, and you would see it in the charts.*

So just asked yourself - *Wouldn't Institutions already know this? And if so, why haven't they acted on that information?* Unless you can answer those questions - just stick to what you can see, and what you can see is - *in the charts*.

Does this mean *Institutions* are always right, or that they sometimes don't miss things? Of course not.  But assuming you can out-smart teams of data-scientists that have access to information you don't, as well as unlimited resources - falls under the mistaken notion that one's opinion is just as good as another person's expertise.  

**Uncharmed Life -** Now we come to the final significant mindset issue.  If you were born into wealth, you are used to good things happening to you.  In fact, you are most likely surprised when they don't.   You don't spend your time "hoping things get better", because things *always* get better.  Sure they have problems, but it is more like, "Chet lost his license from racing his Lambo again....now how are we going to get to the party tonight??  I guess my driver will have to take us!"    But for everyone else, *life is a struggle*.  When something good happens, we immediately worry it is going to be taken away.  Just got a raise? Great, I am sure the car will breakdown and that money will quickly be spent.  And we are always *hoping* things get better, always thinking that things *have to turn around at some point, right??*  It becomes a mindset that is so deeply embedded into one's day-to-day thinking that it is almost impossible to shake.  Now transfer this mindset to trading:

When your trade finally gets into profit, what is your first thought?  Most likely it is that you have to take profits!  If you don't the stock will surely reverse and you will go from green to red really fast.   And when your trade is down, do you cut your losses? No! Because it just *has* to turn around at some point, doesn't it?

Think about how this mirrors your daily life - how you don't trust anything good, and always think you are "due" for something positive to happen.

Also think about the result of this mindset - when your trades actually work, you get rid of them and when the don't, you embrace them!  *You have more faith in your losers than your winners!*  ***This results in a huge imbalance and why retails trader lose so much money.  Even if you think choosing a winning position was a coin flip, most people, over time should hover around even.  But they don't, most short-term traders are losing.  Partially because they jump into without the right knowledge and experience, but also because they do not lean into their winners.***

The first thing a successful trader thinks of when their trade becomes profitable is - "should I add to this?", which is 180 degrees different from how an unsuccessful trader thinks.

**Solution -** Cut your average trade size in half. Now, the next time your trade is in profit and you think to yourself that you want to take your winnings off the table, you are instead going to increase your trade size to a full position.  And every time your trade is on the losing end, and you think "it will turn around", you will reduce your position by half.   What is essential is to trade as you normally would (except now you are using reduced trade sizes), and you only increase or decrease your positions when you have those thoughts.   So if you went long **AAPL** at $177.78 with 100 shares (and your normal trade size is 200 shares), and **AAPL** went to $178.50, and you think - I should take profits here, instead you are going to double your position to 200 shares, with an average cost now of $178.13. \* Use your common sense here - obviously if the market suddenly starts crashing, or **AAPL** just hit major resistance you need to take that into account.  After a month of this look at your results.

\-------

Will these solutions completely fix your problems? No, of course not - many of these issues are deeply ingrained into your personalities and worldviews.  But recognizing them, and working them is an essential step towards becoming successful.

Best of luck!
