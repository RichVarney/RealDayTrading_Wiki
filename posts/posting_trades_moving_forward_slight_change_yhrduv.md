I will try to outline what I see as a potential "disconnect" or "confusion".  Whether or not I will be able to successfully articulate that issue remains to be seen, but nevertheless, as usual, I shall give it shot.

Let's start with something that I know isn't, as of now, communicated well - 

Everyone joining this sub is told that it will take roughly two years to learn everything that is taught here, and reach the goal of consistent profitability.  The Wiki outlines exactly what that process is, and focuses on two primary areas of study: **Method** and **Mindset**.  Simple enough in theory, right?

The part that remains unsaid is that this is just the *foundation* of your trading career.  Without that *foundation* it would not be possible to move forward, but the *foundation* is just the beginning.  It gets you to the point where you can be consistently profitable using a method that has a distinctive edge while maintaining a mindset that allows one to do this for a living.  

So why not just stop there? I mean, you're consistently profitable at this point - why change anything?

Because, that *foundation* needs to be built upon. Just like if you decided to go into Law, Medicine, Physics, etc...at some point you need to decide where you want to specialize.  Nobody just *does Law*, there are *Tax Attorneys, Defense Lawyers, Prosecutors, etc..etc.*  

And how one decides to build on that *foundation* will determine the type of trader they will be going forward.  You may have noticed that of the full-time traders you see here, each of us have very different trading *styles* and *skill-sets*.  Those *styles* and *skills* were built on top of that *foundation* that each of us has at the core of our trading. For example, u/onewyse and myself both share the same *foundation* of knowledge, but we trade quite differently from each other.  Everything from our tolerance for risk, to whether we "trade what is in front of us" or "trade a larger thesis", can at times be, miles apart.  Whereas other times we'll find ourselves in the exact same trade for the exact same reasons.

Here's the good news - once you do make it past that entry-level, you will have enough ability and knowledge to be able to chart your own course.  Some of you may become more inclined towards "scalping", others might be more conservative using only high-probability option spreads, many might decide to gravitate more towards swing trading while others are going to focus on profiting from intra-day volatility, others still may decide to solely trade futures for a living. **Every trader is different.**  

At this point, I am sure you can see the dilemma for a sub like this?  If I were to post "advanced" trading methods and strategies, do you really think anyone would stick with going through the *beginner* process? Of course not.  Everyone would jump ahead and attempt to integrate any one of the various *advanced* methods before they are even remotely ready.

Ok, now with that part explained - consider this - when I decided to post *every trade* I make, I stuck to that promise.  However, while many of those trades fit neatly into the box of teachings that make-up that *foundation* here, others do not.  

So what happens?  The inevitable questions of: 

*I don't get it, doesn't that trade go against what you said in the Wiki?,* *Why are you still holding that losing position, aren't we supposed to cut them?, etc.*  

I get the confusion. And you're right.  You are being exposed to trades and trading strategies that are beyond that scope of this sub and your training.  For example:

Back in early Aug. I had a *bearish* thesis as the market was going up - at one point holding a number of shorts that were significantly underwater.  Questions and comments ensued, but within two weeks just about every one of those trades turned a significant profit.  The same thing happened the week of 9/6, again in the beginning of October, then again on 10/18 and of course, right now.  Every time I held to my *bearish* thesis despite a rising market, took considerable heat and then turned a profit on the drop.  

Which isn't to say that I only traded from the short-side during these times, in-fact you will see that many of my intra-day trades were in fact, bullish and therefore, *with the market*.  But my swings were (and are) based on a larger overall thesis for the market.  Trading a larger thesis that runs counter to the current technical environment is definitely beyond the scope of what we teach here, but it *is* part of my trading skill-set. 

All of this is to say that it was probably a mistake to post *every trade*.  

Believe it or not most pro-traders that you see here, including Dave, Pete, Professor, etc..*do not* post many of their trades.  They tend to only post the ones which conform to the *foundation* taught.  

So going forward that is what I intend to do - *only post those trades that match the teachings of this sub.* In fact, Tuesday which starts a new month, gives a nice "clean slate" point to begin a new journal for everyone.  

Much like we did on the last Twitter Space (and if you haven't listened to it, it is really good - [Twitter Space - Live Trading Recording](https://twitter.com/RealDayTrading/status/1585724643775721472?s=20&t=PVDlqEVLZgG-19pp3b8ixQ)) where every trade fell under the category of *high probability* that how I plan to post going forward.   This way there can be no confusion between the trades I am posting that are part of my job as a full-time trader, and those that can/should be used for educational purposes.  

There are only three reasons one should post a trade:

**1)** You feel others can learn from the trade by studying it.

**2)** You are attempting to point out a good opportunity that other traders should consider.

**3)** You are seeking advice / feedback.

As usual, no trade should be *followed blindly*, and anyone following a trade is solely responsible for that trade.  

&#x200B;

Hopefully this will eliminate any confusions going forward!

 

Best, H.S.
