I typically refer people to the [10 Step Guide to Getting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/vczdo1/revamped_10_stepguide_to_getting_started/) when they ask me where to begin their trading journey.  Recently it occurred to me that there might be an essential step missing, one that should happen before you even start on Step 1.

Whether you are looking for some supplemental income or a new full-time career, the road to consistent profitability is the same in terms of time and effort.

The new step I'm proposing centers on mental preparation, bringing you to a deeper understanding of the journey you're about to embark on.

I can not stress this enough - if you are not fully aware of just how *much* you need to do the following, then you might not be ready to start trading.

**Unlearn** \- Unless you are prepared to realize that much of what you learned up until now about trading will not help you and in many cases, will lead you the wrong way, you will be banging your head against the wall.  All of the stuff you spout in chat rooms and forums to try to look like you know what you are talking about is readily available "knowledge" (I use the word loosely here). \*Volume Profiles, Elliot Waves, Fib Lines, Inverse H&S, etc...\*Realize if everyone's relying on the same information and over 90% are still losing money, it's time to question the validity of that information. Toss it.  Come in with a clean slate.

**Expectations** \- This won't take you weeks, months, or even a year before you begin to see consistent profitability.  It will take minimum two years.  Expecting anything different is only going to result in disappointment.  It's like pursuing a degree â€“ be prepared to invest time without immediate financial returns. I often see traders walk away disheartened after a mere six months. It is also equally important to remember that early success can be misleading, and humility in the face of initial gains will serve you well.

**Humble Yourself**  \- It doesn't matter if you are a CEO or a janitor, if you have been trading for years (and losing) or just started - unless you have made a consistent profit then you don't know shit.   Just because the "rules" are easy to learn, does not mean it is not a highly skilled endeavor.  Imagine for moment you just learned how to play chess, it isn't that difficult to figure out, right?  Does that mean you can now win a tournament? Beat a grandmaster? Would you be so arrogant to think you could "improve" on a professional chess player's strategy?  This is honestly one of the more difficult thing for people because they come into this thinking, "This isn't that hard...." or "Others failed but I have always excelled at shit, so I will be able to do it!" and then they get their ass-kicked.  Humbling oneself is so difficult that even after the market constantly beating a trader down they still think they know better than everyone else.  Go into any trading forum - especially outside this community - you would think it is *filled* with profitable traders because *everybody* has to give advice.

I mean if they were being truly honest, this is what the advice should sound like:

"I loved this book <book title here>, it really helped me out, especially the stuff on mindset, now I am losing twice as much as I did before, but I feel much smarter about it!"

"Why did you make that trade? It was clearly retracing and just bounced down from the top of the cloud.  I waited until I saw the cross and *then* I took the trade.  Of course I lost just as much as you, but I can justify it technically!"

"I used to trade like that, driven by FOMO.  Took me a long time to learn self-control. You need to learn the patience to find the right trade and only *then* really fuck up, just like me!"

While comments like that would be more entertaining I doubt people would actually admit to those truths.

Now if you can come to terms with those three things, then you need to take a step back and realize you are still about to embark on one of the most difficult tasks you ever had to complete professionally.  Would you go to Law School on a whim? It would be a major life choice, wouldn't it?

That's the level of decision you are making here.   Obviously, if you just installed ThinkorSwim, threw some money in and figured you would gamble a bit - fine, you don't need to learn much at all.  This is for those that actually want to be consistently profitable from *trading*.

If not, just invest your money long-term and let it sit there.

I am already at a 85% return for the year, something you will never get from Investing, in fact a year that your portfolio beats the S&P is considered a "good year".  So there is definitely a reason to want to trade vs. invest, you can make a *lot* more trading; however, long-term investing is safe and almost guaranteed (unless you are a total idiot).  Don't get wrong, they aren't mutually exclusive, you can do both, it is just the "trading" part that takes the most effort.

There is also little to no barrier to entry here - As long as you have average intelligence you can do this - as I have said many times, I've seen total idiots get their law degree, P.hd, Medical license, etc.  They just had to work harder for it than others.   Obviously there is a range of success amongst pro-traders - but if you work hard enough there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't be able to at least hit your base goal.  This isn't like Baseball or Basketball where no matter how much you practice you aren't going to make the pro-team.  Talent plays a role, there is an X-factor in trading, but that just helps put you on the higher end of the continuum.   The *learned skill* part is something just about all of you can do but not before you come to terms with the magnitude of your decision to try.

So there you have a Step 0 if you will - I hope you all follow it.

Best, H.S.
