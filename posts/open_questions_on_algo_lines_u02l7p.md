As many of you know I am exploring and building up the method of Algo Price Points.  

Previously the method of identifying Algo Lines, pioneered by u/onewyse from his direct experience with Institutional traders, had a very clear set of rules.  These rules not only differentiated these lines from basic trendlines, but also gave clarity as to their placement and longevity. 

For example, we knew that when an Algo line was "breached" it was no longer in play.  

However, the advent of Algo Price point has generated some of the questions, some of which carry-over from the previous Algo line instructions.

Here are some that I am currently working on, and I will use the daily chart for **MCD** to illustrate.  On the chart I have 5 numbers, each corresponding to a question that needs to be answered:

[MCD Algo Line Chart ](<img src="cache/images/b32b843a25d002aa88c62f13c5cc5502.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

1. On 4/7 we have a clear breach of not only the Algo line from 3/3 but it also broke through the price point establish by the crossover (#2), as well as through the SMA100.  But on 4/8 there was some profit-taking which pushed the stock below the Algo line and the SMA 100 - however it did bounce off the price point.  ***Question*** \- **Given that the Algo line was breached the previous day, is it no longer active? Or additionally, does the 3/3 candle remain a starting candle and the line is now adjusted connecting to the top of 4/7?**
2. This is the most recent price-point ($251) and while MCD retraced on Friday it seemed to bounce off it almost to the penny - and it seems to have acted more like support than the SMA100 provided.  ***Question -*** **What is the staying power of the price point?**
3. Two price-points were created here at $245.19 and $240.76 - ***Question -*** **are they still in effect as possible areas of support, or do they begin to lose their meaning with time?** $245.19 acted as support from 3/29 to 4/6.
4. This is the longest Algo line on the chart, originating from 1/6 - **iQuestion - does an Algo line increase in strength with the length of the line?**
5. And finally - ***Question -*** **Is there any significance when Algo Price Points also coincide with SMA's?  Does the combination of the two add increased relevance?**

Also - 

A) **We know the Slope of the line matters but at what point is the Slope too severe to be considered a valid line? (*****this is a leftover question*****)**

B) **What constitutes a "breach" - does the candle have close above the line? If it is wick, meaning the price breached the line but then retraced in the same day - is the line still valid?** **(*****this is a leftover question*****)**

u/onewyse \- please chime in if you have any insights!

Anyway, these are the open questions I am currently working on, which requires going back through a lot of stocks and looking at the impact of these instances and their corresponding results.  I will keep everyone posted as to the findings!

 

Best, H.S.
