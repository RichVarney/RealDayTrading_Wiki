EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

I know....me, lose money trading?? Seems hard to believe.

Sigh, but there was a time when I was a fresh-eyed noob and thought I knew everything. Those were fun days.

Back then there were lots of ways I would screw up, but one stands out in particular. Perhaps some of you can relate?

The morning would start and I would be there for it - Adderall, check. Coffee, check. Mango Juul, check.

The moment the open bell rings I would see my list of morning gappers take off. Stock was at $3, now it’s $4, and looks to be heading to $5. It’s climbing my Active Trader ladder fast.

But wait, it’s not the only one! Several stocks are “gapping and going”!

FOMO sets in. Like a crashing wave. I’m convinced that everyone else is making a killing on these stocks. Everyone but me, that is.

So I quickly put in orders. 2,000 shares of one stock, 4,000 shares of another. And I go green for a second and then they start dropping. No stop for me, these stocks are movers, not going to get stopped out of a winner! I would always think back to that one time I got stopped out of a stock right before it shot up.

But now they’re back down to opening price. I’m in the hole by $1 a share on one and $1.50 a share on the other. It’s too late to sell now. I just have to wait. And wait. And wait. As the day wears on I realize I’ve been staring at these ladders for hours. Volume has dried up and the stock isn’t moving.

Do I just hold them? Maybe the magic returns. It doesn’t. It never does.

Ok so no more gap and go for me! Problem solved, right? Nope.

During the day other stocks are jumping, some of these are reputable companies too!

Same process - Same result.

The problem was FOMO. The single biggest killer of day trading accounts.

When you have FOMO you don’t stop to check the charts, you don’t look at the technicals, you just jump in. You never think it will retrace, you think - if I don’t get in now I’ll miss it!

So here’s the solution - take a breath. Don’t take a trade until you looked at the chart and identified levels of support. Don’t buy the stock until you looked to see the catalyst - is it news? sector sympathy? market related? earnings reaction? Don’t make the trade without doing DD on the charts. (see my other posts on the type of DD you should be doing)

Will you miss a few doing this? Sure. But you’ll save yourself from many more.

Anyway, thought I would share what was my biggest issue starting out. If you can’t relate, that’s great, it means you’re not making the same mistake many of us make/made. If you can then just know that this is a common issue, with an easy solution.
