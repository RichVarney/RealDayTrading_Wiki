Hari's reply to this post that should be read first (to remove the misconception of the misconception that RS/RW is not important, when it very much is and is core to our trading strategy here)

And now to my post:

RS/RW is a relatively simple concept, but I noticed some may be considering it is more than what it is: it's simply a trait of a stock in a given point in time.

There's more than enough about this in the wiki, but I fear it bears repetition.

&#x200B;

At its core, RS is just strength relative to SPY, and RW weakness relative to SPY.

In other words, when SPY goes up, it is the tailwind to a RS stock, pumping it up faster, and when SPY goes down, it will drag down a RS stock slower (or make it not rise as fast/stagnate).

The converse is true for RW: When SPY goes up, a RW stock will drag up (or not fall as fast/stagnate). When SPY goes down, it will drag a RW stock down like a dead weight.

&#x200B;

RS/RW is not necessarily a criteria to enter/exit a stock with (the following points are also true for RW, but in the other direction).

* I could have a RS stock, but I sure as hell don't want to go long on a RS stock while SPY is dropping.
   * For one thing - every stock will get dragged down if SPY keeps dropping.
   * For another - RS also can signify that a stock is not dropping as fast as SPY is (but if SPY keeps dropping, eventually, it will drop as well).

Now, can you exit a long stock because it has lost RS? Sure, you could. But it could also keep grinding up, but at the same rate as SPY (and not at a higher rate of a RS stock).

Similarly, can you stay in a long stock because it has RS still? Sure, you could. But it could also start dropping, but not as fast as SPY.

&#x200B;

You must keep the market first mentality. Every time you think about any action you're about to take, you have to look at SPY first. It is totally ok to be wrong about what the market's doing (we're all learning here after all) - it is not ok to ignore the market.

Let's look at SFM today:

[SFM, entries \(green arrow\) and exit \(red arrow\)](<img src="cache/images/9ecc02c9ce4779cf473b3958a018e182.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

This was my shining jewel today (yes, even more so than the TSLA scalps). This play gave me 25% of my gains.

I entered shortly after the start of my day (11:49 market time). Notice how the trend keeps going up even as SFM drops at my point of entry. Do I know if SFM is going to drop? No - but I am relying on the trend continuing. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But it manages to hold a small green bodied candle on the SPY drop at 11:49 market time.

It continues to grind up, with continuing HA candles all the way up (note: I put the regular candles here, but once I enter a trade I tend to focus on the HA candles to see if the trend continues).

SPY has a general trend going up (some dips here and there), but during the SPY dips, SFM holds and continues to go up.

My exit point is when I see the red HA candle start to form and stay - I take profit at 2:04 market time.

RS, along with HA candles, allowed me to stay in this trade through the dips in SPY. If I relied on RS alone to exit, I could have exited at many points - 12:10 market time, 12:30, 1:05 on RRS indicator, 1:10 on quick-n-dirty RS/RW. None of those would have been a good an exit as the one I did at 2:04, where RRS was still showing great strength, and quick-n-dirty RS/RW was still showing a little bit of strength but dropping.

&#x200B;

Am I cherry picking a great play? Yes, I am. But this specific example drives home my point: focus on the market and the stock's trend. RS/RW goes on top of that, not in place of.

Don't think of RS/RW as this magical indicator that will solve everything for you. It is an edge - that's it. It's a great edge, but not much more than that.

&#x200B;

If you're having trouble during these tumultuous times, I highly suggest Hari's post of [Keeping It Really Simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/svn70b/keeping_it_really_simple/) \-- and realize that along with those 4 rules, here's a corollary: Don't go long on a stock just because it has RS, even if SPY is dropping (or short a RW stock when SPY is rising). Trade with the market. (Notice how Hari's post does not mention RS/RW, but how the market is?)

&#x200B;

And as always, I hope this helps. If it does not, please tell me so I don't waste your time with useless posts.
