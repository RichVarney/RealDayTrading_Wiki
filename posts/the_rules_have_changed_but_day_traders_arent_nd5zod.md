Technical Analysis is the bread and butter of Day Trading.  *Real* Day Traders scoff at those who use the WSB-YOLO method of Day Trading, for many reasons, but the main one being - **it is not consistent**.  For those that want Day Trading as a career the most important thing is *consistency.*  Without that you don't have a career, as you do not have a guaranteed source of income.  Technical Analysis provides that consistency.

For the purposes of this post let's assume that when I say Technical Analysis I mean **anything** that has to do with price-action.  All indicators, chart analysis (support, resistance, moving averages, etc), volume considerations, price fluctuations (including Level II interpretation) and algorithmic models ***all*** will fall under the umbrella of technical analysis.

The problem is that in the past two years Technical Analysis as been *breaking down*.  Why?

Well to begin with I believe that what we are experiencing in 2020-2021 is a once in a generation market event.  Yes, the market is irrational, but these past two years have gone from irrational to insanity.  The virus, the Fed pumping unprecedented cash with low rates, all while making the Bond market unattractive, unsustainable P/E ratios, have combined to artificially push this 10 year bull market way past its expiration date.  We *should* be in a bear market right now. 

Now it is important to note that technical analysis works insofar as others follow it as well - Support works because other traders and institutions also know where that support is and respect it.  In other words, the basis of this type of analysis is really that everyone else is looking at the same setup you are, and they are making their decisions the same way you are - so when you see a stock approaching resistance you sell it (or short it), and so is everyone else - and then, surprise-surprise, the stock goes down.  Because both institutions (those algos are based off those technical indicators, most simply follow the algo trendlines) and retail traders tend to act with a groupthink psychology, ***unless*** there is a mitigating event that overcomes those technical indicators; a news event, a short squeeze, earnings, and then you are momentum trading.

But now things have changed a bit and I think there are two reasons: 

**1)** There have been a huge influx of new retail traders into the market this past 18 months and they don't care one bit about technical analysis, there are more WSB type traders than true Day Traders now, and they are buying or selling based off a different criteria (some strange combination of Gut and Fundamental Analysis of the float), and

**2)** Institutions which make up most of the volume are now playing by different rules. Sure a stock may have support at a certain price, but if those institutions suddenly feel like inflation is going to increase they are going to dump their holdings and fast.  Suddenly your reliance on that support-level as a retail trader is no longer as safe as it once was.  And why are institutions so jumpy, so prone to violating those sacred rules of technical indicators?  Because look at the market - they know full well that at any moment it can jump up to SPY 430 or crash so hard that 1929 would say, "Damnnnnn".  They don't trust it.

As Day Traders there is one solution this to - ***expand your toolkit***.

Let's say Stock XYZ is up $14 going from $250 to $264, and it continues to grind higher.  Well perhaps a Call Debit Spread of 265/267.5 for a debit of .95 cents that expire that week is the best option, and you get a credit of $1.20 by the eod.  Perhaps selling the $23 put for .40 cents is the best bet for the Stock that is at $24.30 and rising, and then buying it back for .25 cents.   Try combining Day Trading with Swing Trading by only Day Trading stocks that look good on a daily chart, that way you can hold it overnight if you need to without much worry.

Buying or Shorting Stock.  Buying or selling Options.  Buying or selling Spreads.  Each of these have pros/cons and each can be tailored to fit the situation.

Now more than ever a successful Day Trader needs a deep bench of strategies, and a flexibility in how they trade.  You need to learn how to trade in down markets and flat markets.  If the market crashed on Monday, do you have a plan on how you would best take advantage of that?

The market is more dynamic than it has ever been, so you need to be as well.   One thing is for certain - if all you are doing is looking pre-market and seeing a stock like EYES up 65% and grabbing it after the first pullback, you are eventually going to get burned, badly.

Trade Smart!

Edit: In terms of holding a day trade overnight. I am not talking about morning gappers.  I also day trade stocks like BILI or FUTU, MSFT or FB, etc...all the time.  For example on Friday I scalped DKNG but would not hold it overnight if it turned against me, because the Daily chart is ugly as hell.  But TMUS on the other hand, was a safer play, the daily chart is so strong that even if someone got in at 142 and is now down about 50 cents a share, the daily chart is such that they can hold it over the weekend if they wanted.  I would **never** suggest holding a high volume gapper that is under $10 a share overnight, *that* is insanity.
