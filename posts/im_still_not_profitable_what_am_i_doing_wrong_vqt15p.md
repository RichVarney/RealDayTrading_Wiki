I am going to be blunt here - *Of course you are not profitable*.

Outlined, in the Wiki, are 10-Steps - those steps take roughly 2 years. 

Unless you have completed those 10-Steps I would be *very surprised* if you were consistently profitable.

You wouldn't expect to pass the final of a course if you rarely attended the class, would you?  Or maybe you would - maybe you are the type that has always been able to get away with shit like that.

Guess what? Not here.

Because here is the secret - the trick - the thing - the whatever the hell you want to call it - 

***It doesn't take two years learn the method - it takes two years to change your mindset.***

Hell, you can learn this method in a month.  It's not rocket science.  Yes, there are a million contextual things that come with experience, but overall it doesn't take a genius to figure out *Relative Strength and Weakness.*  

If you are an absolute beginner it might take some time to learn the basics and figure out things like your platform or scanners, but even all that doesn't take more than 4 to 6 months to get down.

In other words, you can learn *how to trade* relatively quickly.  You can even learn *the right way to trade* fairly quickly.  But it takes at least two years to learn *how to be consistently profitable*. 

The steps in the Wiki are designed to reframe your mindset, one step at a time.  As you are learning and perfecting the method, what you are really doing is changing the way you think.

Almost every trading issue I see is due to psychological issues with the core concept behind buying and selling assets in the short-term. 

Those issues may be masked as problems with *technical analysis* and at first they may be, but after awhile, they aren't.  Because unless you are a complete idiot, you know exactly **what you should be doing**.  Again, this isn't a mystery here.  

*You shorted against a strong market?* 

*You tried to pick a top or a bottom and got crushed?* 

I am guessing that didn't work out for you? I am shocked. 

***Your problem is counter-trend trading which is a mindset issue.***

*You loaded up on OTM Calls right before earnings and they are now worthless?*  

*Decided to buy the stock right before its' earnings?*

And now you are in the red by a lot? Go figure! 

***Your problem is a gambling mentality, which is a mindset issue.***

*You averaged down on a stock that kept dropping?*

*You held on to your loser and it never turned around?*

Just never seem to catch a break, do you? Yeah...you won't.

***Your problem is a fear of loss, which is a mindset issue.***

**All of these issues are deeply rooted in a mindset that serves us well in regular life, but is disastrous when trading.**  

**It takes a** ***long*** **time to finally understand that you need to look at trading very differently than you view the rest of the world.**  

That is what the two years is for, that is what the ten steps is meant to do for you - *Change your mindset*.  And until you do - you will **not** be consistently profitable - it just won't happen.

**So if you don't have the time or patience to go through the process, or think you can take shortcuts to this, my advice is to simply stop trading and look for a better use for your money.**

**This is your holiday public service announcement :)**

Best, H.S.
