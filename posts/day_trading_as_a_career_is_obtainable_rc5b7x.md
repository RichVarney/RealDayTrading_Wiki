There seems to be a *huge* disconnect between what is actually occurring in the world of short-term trading and what many people here believe is happening.

To begin with - there are many consistently successful traders that make enough profit year after year to live quite comfortably. And they all rely on some form of technical analysis to do their **jobs**.

But if you read these forums, just about every post is filled up with comments that claim Technical Analysis doesn't work, or that Day Trading is simply gambling (*seriously, why are those people even on these forums if they think that way).*

To get one obvious point out of the way - It would be statistically impossible for a large number of people to be *consistently* profitable, year after year, if Day Trading were based primarily on chance. Unless all the traders I know are just supernaturally lucky day in and day out, it takes **skill**.

Secondly, Technical Analysis not only provides the basis for these traders to do their jobs, they are also the foundation of algorithms used by large institutions. You can be certain if those algorithms weren't profitable, they wouldn't use them. But they are.

Finally, you can *back-test* almost every pattern or indicator to see it's level of success.

Every successful trader has their own preference for which metrics they use and how they interpret them, but they all have one thing in common - their analysis gives them an *edge* over whomever takes the other end of their trades. **It isn't luck, it is skill**. Skill that is the result of an immense of amount of hard work. As I have said in the past - being a successful Day Trader is really fucking hard. Only those that treat it as a job and put in the time/effort can be successful.

But all that doesn't matter because here comes *BrianDead007* commenting that the entire thing is a casino and TA is bullshit. Not only is that an insult to all the hard-working traders out there, but it is very discouraging for people hoping to learn a new skill that could give them financial freedom one day (unfortunately it is very encouraging for those that *want* to treat the market as a casino).

It doesn't take Freud to figure out who these people are - clearly they tried to trade and lost money, most likely *a lot* of money. Instead of admitting they screwed up and didn't do it correctly, they instead would rather believe that the entire thing is random. Because if *they* can't learn this, *nobody* can.

Just so everyone is on the same page here -

There are many successful Day Traders who do this for a living (a *very good* living for most), they all use Technical Analysis in some way, and are consistently profitable year after year.

Their world of trading is *very* different from the one you see on these forums. They are not rushing in during the first 30 minutes in the morning, they don't get FOMO (or at least they don't *act* on it), they rely on a fine-tuned set of indicators, they have a plan before they enter a trade, and they are constantly going through charts - before and after-hours.

It is not that some don't grab that huge gap up first thing, it is just that is only a small portion of that they do. Having a career Day Trading and the Day Trading you see on YouTube are not the same thing at all. 90% of what you see on YouTube is meant to try to make Day Trading look easy. Who wouldn't want to grab $XYZ at $3.50 at 9:32am and then exit at $4.75 at 9:57am? But that is all smoke and mirrors....and not *real* Day Trading. Very few Day Traders are consistently successful using only that method.

The good news? Becoming a successful Day Trader is a **real** and **attainable** goal.

The bad news? It is not the *Gap and Go* method for an hour and then you're done for the day.
