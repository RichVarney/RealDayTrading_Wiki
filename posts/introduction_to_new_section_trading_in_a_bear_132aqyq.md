Like most of you, when January 2022 officially put us into a **Bear Market** it was the first time I ever traded under that designation. 

For those of you with the misfortune of having got to know a bit about me, then you won't be surprised to hear that I do not like unfamiliar situations. 

Given that there was no choice but to trade the market as it is, not as we wish it to be, I put in the time to try to familiarize myself with the new environment.  How bad could it be? I mean, it is the opposite of a *Bull Market*, right? Instead of going up, it goes down. Simple.  

Still, just to make sure I was as prepared as possible I looked at previous Bear Markets, read up on their characteristics, looked at the charts and noted how they differ from a **Bull Market**, then I  spoke to some of the older traders that can remember 2008-2009 (some even recall the dot-com bubble of 2000) to get a first-hand perspective. 

Looking back, those conversations really should have been the first hint that something wasn't quite right. It felt as if I was asking a Vet about their time in 'Nam and any minute I was going to get some admonishment like, "Son, War is Hell....and some of us just don't make it out alive". Which is a bit strange considering the topic was trading Bear markets not hiding out in the jungle waiting to kill someone.  

Despite that retrospective red flag, I felt I was ready.   I certainly never had an issue shorting and I navigated my share of "chop" days before, so bring it on Bear!

**What a na√Øve little bastard I was...**

After a year and a half, I get it now...Bear Markets are pure hell.  You either adapt or go broke.  

Was I losing? 

Let's not get carried away (although I did have my first *Red* month in several years this past fall, not an experience I wish to repeat). 

Still I could see that my average results were being impacted.  For one they were lower, which is never a good thing. Even more concerning was the Standard Deviation around my average profit....was getting bigger.  In essence I was making less money *and* there was less consistency to it.  That is a dangerous combination for any business (*and this* ***is*** *a business).*  It became obvious that at this pace, it would be come unsustainable pretty fast.

**So why? What was happening?**

Let's start with the foundation of what we do - **Technical Analysis**.  You know, all those lines, *Support* here, *Resistance* there, etc.  You can knock TA all you want, but without it, there is no Day or Swing Trading.  

Now, don't get me wrong, it's not that it doesn't work in a Bear Market, it does.  It just doesn't work, consistently.  

Imagine driving and along your route are Stop Lights.  They are still work and cars come to a stop when they see a Red Light, they go when it is Green, and so on. *Except* every now and then, those Stop Lights become, meaningless. You can look for an answer as to why a bunch of cars are saying "fuck it" and just driving through a Red Light, you can ask around to see why you weren't told about this whole Red, Green, Yellow...Who Cares, just Go mentality?  Maybe you missed the memo? Nope. No memo. You didn't miss shit, because there is no rhyme or reason for when and where those lights will simply become, irrelevant.   Those conditions would make driving really difficult, right? 

I am sure there are better analogies out there, but the point remains.  Sometimes a level of *Support* or *Resistance* acts exactly as it should - rejecting buyers/sellers attempt to drive the price past that barrier. Other times, those lines are breached - not *attacked with volume* as you might expect, but simply breached as if they weren't there.  

Bear Markets are also *far more* ***News Driven*** then Bull Markets.  In fact, a majority of the overall *Price Action* in a Bear Market is the result of some external socio/economic event. 

To put it in perspective, imagine once again you are in that world of optional Stop lights and now you are shopping at a grocery store.  Somehow you made it to the store with just a few dents on your car, but it still works.  You have your list, and your cart, things are good. Hell, maybe you will grab that Ice Cream.  *You deserve it!*  

However, at random intervals a voice comes on speakers in the store, saying something like, "**This might be the LAST time you can EVER get fruits and vegetables!"** Which is of course then followed by a mad dash to the produce section, where previously normal, peaceful shoppers are ready to fight to the death for an Orange. 

So now there you are - holding a bag of busted up Plums, looking at your dented car and wondering why you even bothered leaving the house.  I feel you, I do....I would be more than happy to never leave the house.

But that's not all - 

***Bear Markets Do Not Trend*** \- You would think they would, right? I mean, at least one would assume they trend down, right? Bear. Bear equals down. Right??

As it turns out, in a Bear market a trending day, up or down, is very rare.  Most days consist of mind-numbing compressions where **SPY** goes absolutely nowhere, and then suddenly it either spikes up or falls through the floor.  Sometimes it will just *melt up*, but you won't trust it, so you just sit there and watch it like some Stock Market Cuckold.  Everyone else is going long, but you're being prudent, *you know better*.  So you wait, you and your bruised Plum, because you are going to get the jump on this melt-up when it reverses!  Yeah....no reverse. Eat your plum. 

Oh and while we are at it, as an added treat, all of a sudden the Economic Calendar that nobody gave a shit about becomes *extremely* important.  In a Bull Market we didn't care when the **CPI** came out, hell, most of us didn't even know what it was, and we were more than happy not knowing.  Now not only do we have to know *and care*, but we also need to know what the hell all of it means.  

Why? Because who knows when some guy wearing tweed is going to start talking about an inverted yield curve and throw the market into a tailspin!  And that's that thing!  There are countless guys in tweed out there and they all have shit to say.  Tweed guy (and it is almost always a guy) says the 10 yr Auction came in high - apparently that means it is time for **SPY** to drop!  Oh but wait...FED Speaker #1 is saying something, FED Speaker #1 beats Tweed Guy!  FED #1 says maybe it is time to pause rates!  That means the market is going up!! Wait! No! Another FED Speaker pops up, Fed Speaker #2 and she just said more hikes are needed, and this is a voting FED Speaker, so that means we are going down!  Great, time to short, right?  Nope!  I mean Fed Speaker #2 is voting member, nothing beats that! Unless you are some people in Michigan that want you to know they just ran some models and it says that Inflation is going to be lower than expected in a year.  Well, hell - if that ain't a reason to pop the market up, I don't know what is!   And all of this can happen in the span of 30 minutes. On any given day.  At random.

Through it all sectors are rotating intraday, stocks that were strong in the morning are now weak, volume is non-existent until it all comes back in a single candle, and by the end of the day you feel like you just finished playing poker against some drunk college student who thinks they are Phil Ivey because they went all-in with 7-2 off-suit and won the damn pot.  

One thing is clear - this market is **very** different than the one we just came out of for the last ten years.    

So what does that mean for us as traders?

**1) It is a great time to** ***learn*** **how to trade.** You will be exposed to just about every scenario imaginable and master invaluable skills to use for when sanity finally returns.  Will a Bull Market be easy? Yes - in comparison. Sure, trading is never easy, but it will be a hell of a lot *easier* than this crap.

**2) It is a terrible time to be** ***learning*** **how to trade with** ***real*** **money.**  As the Wiki ([WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/wiki/index/)) points out many times, you need to start with paper trading and continue until you hit the milestones laid out.  Only then should you progress to a *single share*.  If you have been following this than you have been able to take advantage of not only training in this environment,but doing so with minimal risk.

**3) Sometimes it is better** ***not to trade*****.**  There are some days where the market is going to be so choppy and unreliable that your best move is, no move at all.  Does that mean you get up and come back another day? No you lazy fucker, it doesn't.  It means you take that time to study, mark up charts, set alerts, ask questions, etc.  Remember, *this is a job and the sooner you treat it like one the sooner it will actually become your real job.*

**4) Know when to Adapt.** And here we come to the segue into what will become a new section of the Wiki.  First let's address the primary question - *Does the method taught here still work in this market?* And the answer is - YES.  All of the strategies and methods taught in this sub continue to produce repeatable profitability.  However, I have found there is about a 15-20% decline in the expected results.   Like any business if you see a 15-20% decline in revenue, you need to address it.  Which is exactly what I noticed - the amount of money I take out of my account each month has, on average, declined by 15-20% since the beginning of the Bear Market.  Much of this is due to the reasons already discussed above.   So I had a choice, I could either just accept the lower amount, or find a way to make up for the losses by looking for additional edges.

Given the changed landscape and the mercurial nature of the market I put everything on the table, most notably, the following three: 

**Earnings trades**

**Counter-Trend**

**Scalping**

The idea here was to find something that was *repeatable* while still using the methods taught here as a foundational starting point.  

I can tell you what **did not** work - *Scalping*.  

While I have found some success in this area, it is not repeatable.  It is extremely unfortunate that this method is the one that most new traders use.  This is due to a PR problem with short-term trading.  Basically, most people believe that *scalping* **IS** short-term trading.  Can you blame them (well, yeah, I guess you can....)? It is due to getting served one moronic YouTube video after another when you search "Day Trading".  Some guy, and again, it is almost always a guy, is sitting by a bank of monitors, each one looking very busy with a lot of charts, numbers and tables,  and he tells you how if you just have a few thousand dollars in your account that is ***all*** you need to get started!  Typically it ends with our hero trader in some audacious car he rented (almost always a Lambo).    The comment section is filled with bots and his family members all gushing about how much money they made thanks to him and his super system!  In fact, it is **SO** good, Institutions **hate** that you can learn it!!

Anyway, it doesn't work - it is not consistent in a Bull market, and it is not consistent in a Bear market.  Fun? Hell yeah. But not profitable.  

***However, I WAS able to identify several strategies that are able to not only produce consistently profitable results and were able to make up for the 15-20% decline in my monthly average, they also managed to boost that average by roughly 20% (a 35-40% swing).***  

**Caveats:**

As far as I know - these only work in the current *Bear Market* and the conditions we have all traded in over the past six months.  Would they work once this market starts trending, either up or down?  Unknown.  The results I have experienced over a significant number of trades have all been compiled within the context of *this* market.  Therefore while I can confidently say that these methods are verified, I cannot vouch for their ability in a Bull Market.

It is also important to note that these strategies diverge from the ones taught in the Wiki, sometimes directly contradicting them.  ***This does not mean those methods do not work, in fact they DO work most of the time.***  ***As such, these methods that I will outline should be seen as*** ***supplemental*** ***NOT as a replacement.*** Don't forget I started this exploration because of a 15-20% reduction in profits, which means I was *still profitable* using the methods taught.

Finally - my biggest hesitation is this: 

**YOU SHOULD NOT BE DOING THESE STRATEGIES UNTIL YOU HAVE MASTERED THE ONES IN THE WIKI FIRST.**

Now I know what you are thinking, and....stop thinking it!  

"Well, I am losing right now with the strategy in the Wiki, so I might as well try this one just to see if it works".  If you are thinking anything close to that then smack yourself in the face.  After that, look in the mirror.  If you do not see a big red mark, you did not smack yourself hard enough.  Repeat this until you can clearly see the hand print.  

**YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOSING RIGHT NOW!**  Nobody consistently makes a profit until they put in a ton of time and work.  And if you *did* put in the two years of time and work, following everything and still aren't consistently profitable - then definitely do not try these supplemental methods!  Trading is clearly not for you.  

Ok - now that those caveats, that nobody will listen to, are out of the way - I will start a series of posts that outlines the following three *supplemental* methods:

1) **Earnings trades** 

2) **Countertrend trades**

3) **Rule Subversion** 

Onward we go!

Best, H.S.
