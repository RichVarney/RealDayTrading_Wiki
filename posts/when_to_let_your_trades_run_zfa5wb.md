Traders are always complaining about something. I guess it's our nature. One of the biggest complaints I hear is, "I always exit too early and I leave a lot of money on the table." There are a number of issues that could be in play. Your position is too large, your confidence is low or you have the unrealistic notion that you are going to exit perfectly. Each of those deserve a separate article, but I am not going to address those today. Here is an angle that you might not have considered. Is the market in a trend day?

If you've read my posts, you know my chant - Market First! We don't often get trend days, but when we do, you want to let your profits run. 

[This morning I recorded a video and you can watch it now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnRCfnkt-fQ)

I describe how we identified Monday and Tuesday as trend days very early in the day. This video has a lot of technical analysis and a bullish and bearish pick in it.

Here are some of the key elements to trend days. 

**1.** Major technical D1 breach.

**2.** Heavy volume.

**3.** Candles of a single color.

**4**. Little to no retracement. 

**5.** Easily through prior day's high/low

If the market and the stock exhibit these characteristics, all the checkboxes are marked. Ride that trade like a rented mule and have the confidence to weather some speedbumps along the way. 

Trade well.
