Previously I had made an argument in favor of using a Margin account for those that have an account balance under $25K.    That post can be found in the Wiki, or right here:

[Margin Vs. Cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/ruj9w6/margin_vs_cash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

However, after spending several months experimenting with various methods using a sub-$25K account I have come to the following conclusions:

\- **In a trending market it is still** ***much*** **better to use a Margin account** 

\- **In a choppy market it is better to have a Cash account**

\- **If you are in the "1-Share" a trade phase of your training, it is also better to use a Cash account**

Trending market allow for *Swing Trades* \- the ability to successful Swing trade, particularly using Option Spreads, helps mitigate against the PDT restrictions.  

However, a Choppy Market (which, in many ways, a Bear market is, by definition) does not lend itself towards Swing trading for obvious reasons.  The best way to take advantage of a Choppy market is to Day Trade the volatility, which one can not do with a Margin account under PDT-Restrictions.

For that reason it is better to use a Cash account which allows you (within the limitations of your cash settlement) to Day Trade as often as you like.

Further, if you are only trading 1-Share as you work on improving your *win-rate* and *profit factor*, you need to be able to Day Trade the methods taught here - which once again, a Margin account precludes you from doing.  

So consider this a slight amendment to the previous post.  I will update the Wiki as well.

 

Best, H.S.
