There are so many damn theories on trading the open.

Some people say they *only* trade the open and first hour, and they won't trade the rest of the day.   Let's ignore those people.  Are there some that can do that? Sure....a few - *very few.*  Not advice you want to listen to.

Some say they love trading the open, and they also trade the whole day, but the open gives them great opportunities.

Others will tell you to wait 15 minutes.  Others still will say wait 30 minutes.  And there are some that advise holding off on trading for the first hour.

So....who is right?  

Well...all of them, except for the first person, the first person is never right, but the rest are all correct.

Because - it depends on:

1) *Your trading style*

2) *Your level of experience*

Let's start with this - 

***Rule 1***: ***Unless you are a consistently profitable trader do not trade the first 15 minutes.***

***Rule 2: If you are a consistently losing trader do not trade the first hour.***

***Rule 3: If you are a good trader, but not yet consistently profitable, wait at least 15 minutes.***

***Rule 4: If you are new trader or still learning trader, and not consistently profitable, wait 30 minutes.***

***Rule 5: If you are a consistently profitable trader - trade whenever the hell you want.***

Now you might think....*"I don't wanna wait to trade, I wanna trade right away! If I wait I will miss all the price action! And what about the morning gappers?"*  (yes I know that sounds really "whiny").  And you're right, you *will* miss all of that, and you *will* get FOMO as you see people jump in and take trades.   But here's the thing - the first 30 minutes (and really the first hour) is very dangerous - because it is extremely volatile and the indicators one would normally use to find order amongst that chaos are not as reliable.

For example, I see people referencing VWAP after 15 minutes.  Really??  You are going to depend on a weighted average by volume after just 15 minutes of price action?  These indicators and averages need time to settle.   

In sense you are going in blind, with only the candlestick patterns to truly guide you.  Reversals are sudden and without warning.  In particular, the market overall is prone to immediate reversals, which will dramatically impact your trade.  

In other words, it is not a time that non-experienced traders should be trying to ride momentum stocks for a profit.  Instead you should be observing the market, observing which stocks and sectors are moving and how, looking for the best set-ups.  

If you look at my trades in this 100 trade challenge, you will see a few of them made early on, but most of them are made throughout the day - *there are plenty of opportunities after the first hour*.

Best, H.S.
