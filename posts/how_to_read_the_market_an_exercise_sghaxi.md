I was recently asked a question by u/daytraderSandi which I felt deserved its' own post as an answer.

Last week I was able to *read the market* \- in the midst of what seemed like a never-ending selloff I narrated what was happening between buyers and sellers, and what was likely to happen.   And despite some after-hours anxiety with an extended drop in S&P Futures, the market followed the outline I laid out to everyone.  

The question was simply - outside of simply saying "*experience"*, how can one learn to effectively read the market?

All I can do is tell you what worked for me as I was learning how to trade: 

Every day/week I would look at the market, and write out the overall story I felt was being told to me.  

For example, right now I look at the market, and see how it did not get below major support, however it remains extremely volatile intraday (despite really going nowhere).  What that tells me is that on one side you have Bears concerned about the unpredictability of the FED, the fact that the FED was wrong about inflation being transitory, and the *still* overvaluation of equities, and I am thinking - I need to get my money *out* of equities for now.  If I am Bulls I am thinking, the economy is *very* strong, earnings are *very* strong, and interest rate increases do *not* kill a 13-Year Bull market (only a Credit Crisis can do that).  

So the massive swings you are seeing is a combination of genuine indecision, and each side testing the other.  *That is the story I read in the current market.*  I feel that Bulls will win out here, simply because there really isn't enough to drag us into Bear territory.  But I still approach with some caution as this battle is not yet settled.

*However, in the beginning of my trading journey, I was not nearly as accurate, as you might imagine.*  

So I would write down my read of the market each day/week, and my reasons why.  Then I would compare it to the reality of what wound up happening, noting how often was I right.  When I was wrong, I would go back see what signs I missed.    I began to realize I was better at reading Bullish market dynamics than Bearish, and immediately worked on fixing that problem.

At first I would notice I was missing basic things, which makes sense, since I was just learning.  I would miss bounces off major support lines, or clear bid-checks.  Over time I improved on the basics, and moved on to more advanced interactions.

You first need to figure out how good you are *innately,* as some people are just quite good at reading the market with very little training.  Each day, as you write out your story, and then see what happens, you will see pretty quickly how often you are right or wrong.  

Making this a practice allows you to fine-tune your skill in this area, and eventually you will get to the point where misses are rare.  It is important not to let any of your positions bias your analysis.  You might have a number bullish trades on and therefore reluctant to read anything but a bullish story into the market.  It is also important to keep this analysis separate from your trading until you know you are becoming *accurate*.  

Just always remember, at the end of the day there are Buyers and there are Sellers.  There are Institutions and there are Retail Investors.  Retails Investors do not move markets because they do not act in unison (they did on **GME** and **AMC** but it is very difficult beyond that), so you are left with the buying and selling of Institutions.   The charts show what they did and what they are doing - the story you create comes from those charts. 

Best, H.S.
