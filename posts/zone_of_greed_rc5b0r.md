**Not Waiting For Confirmation**

I get it. You want to be *ahead of the move.* If you wait you will have already missed your chance.

This isn't logic - it is greed (and yes Gordon Gekko, Greed is Good, we all know. We've all seen it).

In this case it is a very well-defined **Zone of Greed**.  This is the specific part of a move that you’re afraid of missing out on if you wait.

The most common way this happens is with **The Gut Call** \- otherwise known as *picking tops and bottoms*.  It can’t go up/down forever right?  So instead of identifying where key technical levels of support/resistance are and then waiting for those to be violated, you jump early.  Who wants to wait until SPY breaks 414.75 before they short it?? That’s 2 1/2 points you’re giving up!  (if you are Day Trading a simple trendline would suffice).

About half of the trades I hear people suggest are based on nothing more than a "due for a reversal" mentality. Remember:

**Successful traders don’t predict the market, they act when the market confirms a direction.** 

Notice I said "Traders", not "Investors". Investors try to predict long-term, but short-term retail traders are jumping on a bandwagon and going for the ride.

The moment you realize that, is the moment you start becoming consistent in your trading. With some notable exceptions (GME), retail traders **do not** move the market, institutions do, and when they do they leave bread crumbs for us to follow. We can see the results of those plays in the price action and if we are patient enough, when those results are confirmed, we can cash in on them.

Humbling, I know.

Consider this - you are an hour into trading and see that TSLA is down $6 on the day. In your experience when TSLA starts the day down, it tends to finish even farther down. So you short it. You didn't look to see if TSLA violated any support levels or what the volume is for that day, you just don't want to miss any more of the downward move. However, perhaps SPY is down $3 on the day so far, a fairly significantly drop and compared to SPY TSLA is actually doing quite well. TSLA has Relative Strength against the market. With the market down $3 TSLA should be down much more than just $6. Thus, the moment SPY rebounds, TSLA takes off and winds up finishing up $9 while your Puts get destroyed.

If you just asked yourself one question - "Do I have technical confirmation?" before making a trade, and moved ahead ***only*** if the answer is "Yes" - your trading results would improve dramatically. Does this mean you give up a certain portion of a move up or down? Yes. But you also give up being wrong so often that it isn't nearly made up for by the times you are right.

That small range that you are giving up is not worth the chance you are taking. For SPY right now that would be a zone of roughly $2.50. Between the current price (417.20) and the support level (414.75). That is the additional profit you would generate if you shorted SPY before a technical breakdown.

It is for this same reason you shouldn't hold a position over earnings. Once again you are afraid of missing a huge move in the stock. But as we have all seen, earnings is a crap shoot - a stock could crush earnings and drop 10% the next day. Wait until you see the response and then play the response. Even worse are people who buy calls or puts right before earnings and then watch as their options get crushed by a deflating IV.

Your goal should be consistent wins every day. You can only reach that goal when you stop chasing huge moves. Ironically you are more likely to see profits when you give up the greed.
