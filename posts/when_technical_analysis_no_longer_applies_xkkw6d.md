**Technical Analysis is the bedrock of what we do as traders.**  

Many people think of Technical Analysis as using the past to predict the present and/or future - but that would not accurate.  If it was then Technical Analysis would be a series of prediction equations, with various models for different situations.

In fact, statisticians and data scientists have tried to "model the market", and found it to be extraordinarily difficult, if not, impossible. 

Take **AAPL** for example - yesterday the market was down, the sector was down, but yet **AAPL** was up.  Any prediction model, whether it be a regression, random forest or agent-based modelling (essentially from *Traditional* to *A.I.*), would most likely have assumed **AAPL** would have declined yesterday.  However, external factors (in particular the sales data on the new iPhones), combined with a need for a "safe-haven" stock, resulted in a Bullish day for the stock.

As for why it is so difficult, the question isn't one of data, there is plenty of data - it is just that there is an almost infinite number of factors and combination of factors that can explain the variance for why a stock goes up or down on any given day.  

**Instead, what Technical Analysis really is, at its' heart, is a series of assumptions based on group consensus.** 

We can all look at the same chart and note where levels of **Support** and **Resistance** are, and we can all agree that those level exist, and that to some degree, the stock abides by those invisible price barriers.  For example, if I see a stock approaching its' SMA 100 on the daily chart, I am not going to go long unless it convincingly breaches that level.  And guess what? Most other traders aren't going to go long either.  

So what happens?  

*Nobody is buying.*

As a result the stock retreats downward - thus confirming our own self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Additionally, Institutions respect those same levels, so much in fact that their algorithms are programmed using them as guideposts.  *And that is what really matters as we will see in moment what happens when they don't.*

While Retail Trading represents roughly 25% of the liquidity in the market, we rarely act in unison (**GME** and **AMC** were rare exceptions when this occurred) and thus, the impact of our buying power is greatly diminished.  In other words, I might be buying **AAPL** and other traders may be as well, but in order to truly move the needle we would need billions of dollars in transactions on the stock.  That amount of money requires the kind of group action that retail traders are simply not capable of pulling off.  **However, Institutions** ***do not*** **need anyone else to move the market - they alone can initiate orders large enough to affect the price.**

But here is where it gets tricky:

First off - are all levels of **Support** and **Resistance** equal?  We certainly treat them as such.  You will frequently hear something like, "Resistance is right above at $100".  *But what kind of resistance?*

Some of you are looking at the Cloud, others are guided by Fib lines (hard to even type that with a straight face), in fact, there are plenty of lines to go around with; horizontal levels, downward and upward sloping trendlines, Algo lines, EMA's and SMA's, Pivot points, Buy and Sell Zones, etc.  

Do they **all** matter?  Do some matter more than others?

Now add to that different time periods - you might have those lines on the daily chart, but what about the weekly? The 4 hour? The 15 minute? The 5 minute? Or even the 1 minute??  

And then there aren't even "lines" so much as a plain ole' price range - whether it is a channel, or just a temporary compression.

Seems like a lot, doesn't it?  But wait....there's more!  For just $19.99, if you act now, you can also get this nice set of ***patterns!***  

It's a Bull Flag!  There is a Cup and Handle forming on the 4-Hour Chart!  Wait....is that an Inverted Head and Shoulders I see there on the Weekly chart? By golly gee it is!!

Ok, so now I am sure you get the point - Clearly not all levels are created equal.  But some have enough general consensus that gives you enough confidence in using them.  For example, **Simple Moving Averages** \- notably the 50, 100 and 200 on the daily chart, are widely assumed to be have enough universal agreement as to provide fairly decent goal-posts to guide our decisions.

However, as we all know, those levels are broken every day - and it is a good thing they are or trading would be rather boring and unprofitable.  *As traders, we look for breaks of key levels - they are significant and meaningful.* 

Why are they so meaningful? Because a stock doesn't simply break a major level for no reason (I have the Boromir LOTR meme in my head) - there is *cause*.  It could be earnings, news, an extremely bullish/bearish market, *something* caused the price to breach that boundary.  

It also stands to reason that the stronger the level, the bigger the reason required to get the stock to break-through.  This question alone would require a monumental effort to solve.  You would first have to rank all the different forms of **Support** and **Resistance** in terms of their likelihood to "hold" or be "breached".  And then you would have to also rank all the various catalysts (earnings, news, etc.) by their impact on either the market a stock specifically.  Finally I suspect you would then need to divide them up into "tiers" with the end result looking something like: "That is a Tier 2 level of Support, and it would require a Tier 3 or higher Catalyst to be breached".  But alas, nobody has done this yet.

Anyway - the question for the moment is - *What happens when the catalyst becomes more important than the levels of* ***Support*** *or* ***Resistance***.  In fact, this *just* happened.  FOMC released and the market lost its' damn mind.  Huge candles down, huge candles up - back and forth, and then finally down down down down.

I was short **AMZN** and the SMA 100 was at $121.41 - however, the strangest thing happened....**AMZN** broke that level, and went back up again, and then broke it again, etc...but that's not the strange thing - the strange thing was - ***it did not even pause when the price hit that level.***  It was as if it wasn't even there at all. If you look through a bunch of chart from 2pm (est) on, you will see many stocks breaking through what would be considered *major lines of* ***Support*** *or* ***Resistance*** without even a bounce or test of the price point.  

And **that** causes a problem.  

Because most traders are still playing by the traditional rules.  Still using Technical Analysis to make their decisions.  But the market doesn't care - the market is playing by its' own rules.

How does this happen?  Well, I will tell you!  Because at times like today *Institutions* take over.  Our shorts or Put Debit Spreads don't even register.  At this point Institutions are driving the market and only they know where they are going.  Not only that but many times individual stocks aren't even on their radar - they are just dumping entire sectors.   As the market dropped today it seems only the closing bell stopped it from falling even further.  So was $375 a pre-set stopping point? Perhaps due to the close of the 6/20 candle being used as a natural resting point before it continues down to the *Low of the Year*? Or did time just run out?  Hard to know.  The point is - they may be using an area for **Support** that is well below the **Support** levels you were looking at for the stock or market.   **AAPL** seemed to respect the SMA 100 on the daily, but **META** looks like it is using the low it registered at the height of the pandemic crash.  

In other words, a trader **must** learn to recognize when external factors are overriding the rules of the game.  

***The higher the volatility the more the traditional rules go out the window.***

And right now we are at a very volatile moment for the market.  

***So what do you do?*** 

Well - not trading is always an acceptable answer.  But that is hard - markets like this is like FOMO on Meth.  Shit is moving - fast! You see people taking $3 here, $5 there and sitting on your hands, while probably the smarter choice, is also not the one most of you will make.

So how do you trade when TA becomes less effective? *Price Action.*

During times like today we all become *Price Action* traders.  When I was short **AMZN**, I was watching the trading ladder and the volume.  Was it moving up with more speed than when it was dropping?  How closely was it following **SPY**?  My thesis was that after the Algos and Short Squeeze was done, the hawkish nature of Powell's speech would settle in and the market was going to drop.  So I was also watching **SPY** very closely -  in particular the volume on the red bars compared to green.  Was it attacking the high of the day as if Investors were finally let loose after the FOMC?  For a moment there it looked possible, but then the upward movement slowed.  If the reaction was truly bullish green bars would have started stacking after that initial long red candle was erased.  Once I saw that wasn't happening, I knew we were going to reverse - then it was just a matter of how weak was **AMZN** and how much would it drop with **SPY**? 

You know what I did not care about? 

The SMA on **AMZN**.  

 

Best, H.S.
