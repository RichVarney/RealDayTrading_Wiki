I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and I don't use any other scan. Just this. Every trade I call out is from this scanner.

It will find any D1 tradable chart doing *any combination* of the following:  


SMA Break  
Compression Break  
3 HA Candles in a row  
HA Reversal  
Strong Trend  


And only show you the results that have a 5 minute chart that's either an HA reversal candle bigger than the last one or two flat bottom HA candles in a row.  


Basically it just shows you the gold that you can enter right away so you can focus on watching the market, mindset, and management.  


Oh and it comes with a new indicator that shows Hari's "Relative-Relative Volume" idea.

Enjoy!
