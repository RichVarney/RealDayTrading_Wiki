I just want to address some conversation I see - 

This sub allows any and all services and resources to post **as long as they are useful and not a scam.**  Unlike other subs that ban any mention of places like Warrior Trading, OneOption, Alpha, etc...this sub does not.  If Warrior Trading wants to post here, they are more than welcome.  

I am a member of OneOption, I have not made an secret about that.  I use ThinkorSwim.  I also use [Finviz.com](https://Finviz.com) and I use TradeIdeas.  I have recommended all of these services at one point or another.  I also like TC2000.  I love Trading in the Zone (book).   All of these have helped me become a better trader. 

As the founder of this sub, I will not shill for any service - and I do not need to - I get nothing out of it.  I will however give my opinion when asked.  

If anyone has an issue, please message me directly and I will happily discuss it with you.
