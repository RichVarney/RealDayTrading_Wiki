For some people the concept of self-sabotage is completely foreign.  Why would anyone want to cause themselves harm?  These are the people that get up at sunrise and make themselves a Kale smoothie before their morning exercise routine.  **And if you are one of those people - fuck off, this post isn't for you.**

As for everyone else? We engage in some degree of self-injury on a daily basis.

We all know of the various activities that cause physical damage - whether is from a poor diet, no exercise, smoking, drinking, drugs, etc..the list goes on.  There are entire industries devoted to getting people back on a "healthier" track in life, and while self-care is important, it is also not the form of self-harm I am referring to here.

I am talking about the type of behavior that constantly gets in the way of achieving any real success, such as;

*You're finally in a good relationship and found someone that clearly loves you?* **Great - time to fuck it up.**

Maybe you're the self-pitying type that thinks you are doing them a favor by releasing them of the burden that is...you.  Or perhaps you simply do not want to belong to any club that would have you as a member.  I mean if they like you then there must be something wrong with them, right?!  (*btw - this is why people are drawn to those that reject them - because those people are clearly of higher value than the ones that accept someone as fucked as yourself*).

*Got a good job, maybe in line for a promotion?*  **Great - time to fuck it up.**

Argue with the boss. Start coming in late.  Screw-up a big project.

*Finally have some money saved up?* **Great - time to hit the casino and fuck it up.**

Because at the heart of every gambler is not the desire to win, but rather the need to hit rock-bottom.

All of this generally comes from some form of self-hatred.  Whether from familial or social rejection in youth, some traumatic event that you felt powerless to stop, or some other deep psychological injury - our psyche takes on the viewpoint of that which caused us pain.  In other words, at some point people like this no longer feel themselves worthy of any success.

Think about your trading now - think about all the times you finally thought you were on the right track.  **And then - BAM.**  **One bad trading day wipes it all away.**  Every single time you get your account back to where it seems like you are actually "getting it", you make a trade that in retrospect was entirely avoidable with various exit ramps, but instead you just froze to watch it implode.  Almost like you have now stepped outside yourself to see the train-wreck occurring in front of your eyes.  *Except you are driving that train.*  At some point you snap at out of it and finally close the trade, but it is too late, the damage is done.

**Usually this doesn't just happened once, but over and over again.  Because the moment you get close to succeeding, it is time to......fuck it up.**

You promise yourself not to do it again.  Rules go into place.  You know what not to do.  And of course, it is just a matter of time before you are staring at your screen in disbelief.

There is no method to learn or strategy to practice that is going to fix this problem.  Because the problem is - You.  You do not think you deserve to be successful. Failure is your comfort zone, as horrible as it feels.  It is what you know best and so that is where you go each and every time.

Obviously dealing with emotional injuries such as this goes way outside the scope of this sub and something one should seek out the help of a professional.  Finding the core reasons behind your need for self-sabotage typically requires someone specifically trained to deal with the issue. Is it possible to fix these problems yourself? Sure - but not likely.

However, in terms of your trading you can better identify the problem:

First create a chart of your P&L and note the days where there are significant drops.  How far apart are they from one another?  Is your account increasing at a steady pace right before it falls off a cliff?  Note when those decline are most likely to happen.

Next look at the trades that have caused most of the damage.  Are they all similar?  Label them.

If you take out your five or ten worst trades, what would your overall P&L look like?  Would you be profitable?

Take all your trades - and put them in a spreadsheet and rank them from worst to best in term of pure dollars made or lost on the trade.

Let's say you have 1,000 trades - what you should see is a tight range (i.e., Standard Deviation) between the your biggest win and biggest loss.  A healthy P&L for example would look like this:

**Average trade: +$85**

**Standard Deviation: $80**

This means that 68% (or 680) of your trades is between +$5 and +$165, and 95% of your trades is between -$75 and +$245.  That would also mean that 2.5% of your trades are below -$75 and 2.5% are above +$245.

And you have no results that are + or - 4 Standard deviations from that mean.  Meaning there are no wins above $405 and no losses below -$320.

Obviously if you are using a bigger account you might have a mean of +$255 and a Standard Deviation of $240.

An unhealthy P&L is either one that has **huge outliers** or looks like this (usually both):

**Average trade: +$200**

**Standard Deviation: $500**

This means that 68% (or 680) of your trades is between -$300 and +$700, and 95% of your trades is between -$800 and +$1,200.  Also with big outliers on the downside.

*Those outliers are the symptom of your issue.*

In the first case of the healthy P&L, it means that you are usually a solid trader with consistent results but every now and then you go off the rails and blow it up.  In the second case it means you are a good trader, but one that takes large risks with bigger than necessary position sizes, which eventually leads to a huge loss.

Identify which of the two best identifies your issue.

If you fall into the first group of the consistent trader that has the occasional day where you lose your damn mind - look back on those days.  You'll usually see a stark difference right off the bat, from the first trade of the day.  Something will stand out that deviates from your typical style.  Zero in on that moment, because that is your sign that things are about to go off the rails.  Maybe you take a risky momentum trade with a larger than normal position size, or you jump in earlier than you typically would - whatever it is, you'll see it jump off the page at you.  Now you know.  Because the best thing you can do is stop trading when you see yourself heading in that direction.  Don't try to control it, don't try to stop yourself and continue trading.  Just get up and walk away for that day.  It will be hard to do, you'll say to yourself, "Ok, I can pull myself back from the edge".  You can't.  You are fucked for the day. Come back tomorrow and you will feel much better.

If you are in the second group your task is much more difficult but also far more straightforward - cut your average position size in half.  Only go to a full sized position when you are halfway to your profit target.   Your problem here is that you are constantly living on the edge of disaster.  There isn't a string of nice calm days and then a huge blow up, but rather it is generally a roller coaster.  Unlike people in the first group it isn't so easy to identify the days where things will suddenly turn into a dumpster fire.  For people in this category it can happen at anytime, on any trade.  The only way to mitigate it is to reduce your overall risk, and the only way to do that is to reduce your average position size.

Neither of these "solutions" will take away the urge to sabotage oneself, but they do make it harder for you to hit that self-destruct button.

Best, H.S.
