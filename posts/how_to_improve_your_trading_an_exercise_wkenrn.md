Obviously there is no **single** way one can improve their trading - and if you are in this sub-reddit than chances are your trading has already gotten better (it certainly could not have gotten worse!).  You may not be profitable yet, but if you have read and followed the Wiki there is very little chance your overall trading has not at least started on the road to consistent success.  

To help with that process, I wanted give you all a somewhat simple exercise that should pay off quite a bit if you commit to doing this every week -

To start with - Here is a list of some of the *top ten* reasons, in no particular order, why traders lose money. While this by no means covers every reason but it definitely captures many of them (I came up with the label names, but feel free to change them to whatever is easiest for you):

\- **Over-Trading**  \- You take too many trades, which by default means they can't all be high probability set-ups.  Most likely they *all* looked good to you at time, but in retrospect you realize that you should have passed on the trade.  Fortunately these "Good but not Great" trades are easy to identify in hindsight.    ***In your trading journal label these trades OT = Over-trading***

\- **Letting Losers Run -** This is most likely the reigning champ of reasons why traders lose money.  You hold on to your losers for far too long.  This is made even more difficult when you are taking trades of stocks with really strong daily charts as by the time those charts begin to take on a different trend than when you entered, the position is already irretrievably down. ***In your trading journal label these trades LLR.***

\- **Cutting Winners Short -** If the impact of each of these mistakes were truly quantified I would not be surprised to see this one actually take the number one spot away from *Letting Losers Run*.  It is a very strange psychological phenomenon that is particular to trading - Once our thesis begins to really work is when we most want to exit it.  ***In your trading journal label these trades CWS.***

\- **Position-Size -** You should trade the chart, not your P&L - that is Trading 101.  However, when you have an over-sized position on you become far more likely to make decisions based on how much money you are down or up, rather than on the technical analysis. ***In your trading journal label these trades PSP - Position Size Problem.***

\- **Misread or Ignored the Market -** Getting the market correct is a crucial part of trading successfully.  If you either misread or ignored the market, your trade stands little chance of working. ***In your trading journal label these trades MM = Missed Market.***

\- **Counter-Trend Trading -** If you are still counter-trend trading after everything you have seen and read here you have bigger issues than this exercise could solve, but just to cover all bases....if you are predicting a top or a bottom, going long a weak stock or short a strong one...this applies to you. ***In your trading journal label these trades IAADa - I Am A Dumbass*** 

\- **Trade Mismanagement -** You screwed up.  Whether you averaged down, or bought back the short side of a spread at the wrong time, you just did not manage this trade well.   ***In your trading journal label these trades TM.***

\- **Did Not Understand -** If you entered a Time Spread, an OTM Bullish Put Spread or any trade, and lost money because you did not fully understand how it worked, then ***in your trading journal label these trades DNU***.

\- **Gambling -** This is very subjective so be careful how you apply it, but essentially - you know it when you do it.  This is seeing a $6 stock jump up to $7 and before checking the chart or reason you just go long - this is basically trying to catch a fast moving trend without any analysis.  This is also when you are using OTM options without a valid reason - for example, you think **TSLA** is going to keep dropping, and instead of doing a Put Debit Spread you decide to grab some  $750 Puts for .50 cents because they are "cheap".   Lotto plays do not apply here. ***In your trading journal label these trades VEGAS.***

***-*** **Bad TA -** When you miss something on the chart, and we all do, it can be costly - e.g. if you go long a position but did not notice there was an ALGO line of Resistance or an SMA right above your entry. ***In your trading journal label these trades BTA.***

***Obviously there are many trades that do not work due to no fault of the trader. Not every loser is a mistake and not every winner is without fault.***  

***First thing to do:***

Go through all your trades from at least your past three months, and tag them with any of the ten reasons above whenever applicable.  Some trades will have more than one tag on it, and hopefully many trades will have **no** tags on them.  You want enough trades tagged to be able to do the second step.

***Second thing:***

Run a simple count to see which of the those errors you commit the most often by percentage.  And then run the average $ won/loss per tag. So it should look like this:

**Vegas - 24% / -$245**

**IAADa - 17% / -$540**

**GNG - 12% / +$121**

**etc.**

and finally run the following:

What percent of all your trades had any of those tags on them in one form or another - so for example - **Total trades for the Month: 120, Total Trades with a Mistake - 40 = 33%**

Average Return of Trades with a Mistake vs. Non-Mistake - for example:

**Non-Mistake Trades = $230 profit average, Mistake Trades = -$295**

And then the total cost of all mistakes for example:

Total return of all trades with a mistake tag = **-$2,321**

***Third Thing:***

Now comes the actual work - each week you are going to pick **ONE** mistake - it should be one of the most committed or most costly at first - and your goal is to reduce both number of times you commit that mistake and the amount you lose.  Your focus is solely on fixing that mistake for that week - so if you choose **IAADa** then you are actively trying to reduce how often your counter-trend trade.

Each week pick a ***different*** mistake to work on, do not work on the same mistake two weeks in a row.

***Finally:***

At the end of each week run all the numbers from the second step again and you should see a reduction in not only the mistake you were working on, but also a reduction in the overall number of mistakes made.  If you see a decrease in the mistake your were fixing, but the overall number of mistakes and losses are the same or higher that just means you replaced one mistake with another.

***If you do this EVERY WEEK within six months you should be able to compare your numbers from when you started and see a DRASTIC improvement.***

 

Best, H.S.
