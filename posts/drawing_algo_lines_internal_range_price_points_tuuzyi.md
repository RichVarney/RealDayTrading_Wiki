To start with - if you haven't read u/onewyse's post on the subject, I suggest you start there:

Next, watch the two videos I just did on the new use of the method:

Let's go through the different types of methods.  To begin with, realize that these are not typical trendline and do not abide the requirements of trendlines, just as trendlines do not abide by the requirements of Algo Lines.  However, there are of course some similarities in their construction which I am sure you will notice.

At times these may seem subjective, I assure you that they are not - in fact, I can set up Algo lines on 100 stocks and u/onewyse can set them up independently and we would match up 99 out of 100.  That is an objective method.  It just takes time and practice to learn it.  Hopefully these videos help.

Since there are various set-ups I wanted to be able rank them in terms of probability for success.  I believe I have found the set-up that results in the highest probability for success.

At the top of that list would be the **Upper - Lower Algo Bounds - Confirmed by Internal Lines** (I really have to come up with better names, I know):

Here is an example of that:

[AAPL Range](<img src="cache/images/44f64e9f1e0402e1cef54724ad87e982.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

And here is another:

&#x200B;

[NVDA Range](<img src="cache/images/dc069099f7ac4030ec5a0c2a86ef59f2.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

And yet another:

&#x200B;

[HD Range](<img src="cache/images/6872dc9119be72b45e5b355a8cb4b6f4.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

You can see within each first the upper and lower range is create with two Algo lines.  Then *within* that range, new Algo lines are formed which connect to the Upper and Lower Lines - Once that connection is made, the further extrapolation of the line is no longer necessary or relevant, you now have your two price points (notice with **AAPL** and **NVDA** they just continue on?).

If you went through 50 stocks and created these two price points for each, setting alerts on all 50 - when those are triggered you will have *extremely high probability trades.*  

***I went back and set up these upper and lower bounds on various stocks up until January, identified the price points they would have given and then looked to see what happened when those points were breached.***  

***In every case they resulted in extremely profitable trades.***

Here is the new video where I walk through this specific method of finding the ***highest probability*** trades:

Have a great weekend everyone!
