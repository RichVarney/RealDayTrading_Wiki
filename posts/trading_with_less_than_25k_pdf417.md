Day Trading as a source of income absolutely requires more than $25K in your account.  Can you use a cash-only account and wait for money to settle? Yes - but you will not have enough flexibility to truly Day Trade.  

However, as many of you have stated - most people do not have $25K to put into an account.  In fact, most of you have less than $5K to work with at any one time.  So the question is - how can you build an account of that size?

As a lot of you just witnessed, I turned a $30K account into $60K in a matter of 5 weeks, but there is something I hope some of you noticed - the last two weeks of that challenge I traded as if the account were under $25K.  In other words, I only used a limited number of Day Trades a week, and primarily swing traded.  The first three weeks of the challenge were meant to show that you can successfully Day Trade without chasing low-float gappers, but the final weeks were dedicated to showing you the profit potential of swing trading.

So how would you do it in a smaller account?  The exact same way - the only thing that changes is the position size.  

A couple of things to note when swing trading - 

**Whenever my portfolio becomes too bullish, I add hedges.**  

**I diversified my holdings amongst various sectors.** 

**I used Call Debit Spread, Diagonals, Put Debit Spreads, Put Credit Spreads as well as Straight Calls and Puts.**

**Every stock had a correspondingly stock or weak daily chart, which allowed me to be patient with the position.**

**Every stock was strong (or weak) against SPY on a daily basis.**

*I did not rush to take profits nor did I cut a trade unless it completely violated the technical reasons I entered.*

*I used less contracts for ITM options rather than more contracts for OTM options.*

***All of these techniques can be used in a small account as well as a large one.  For example, one look at the NFLX daily chart shows that it has broken through both long-standing horizontal resistance and its downward sloping algo line (please look this up if you don't know what it is).  The stock is extremely strong against the market and looks to continue its' upward trajectory.***

***Knowing this about NFLX I chose to use to Bullish Put Spread (i.e. Put Credit Spread) that was ATM, received a 2.70 credit for a $5 spread in strike price.  I chose this method because the premiums for calls were too high and I was not getting a low enough debit for a CDS.  This gives me a 54% return if NFLX stays above 560.  An account with $1,000 in it could do up to 4 contracts on a spread like this, but in the interest of not risking the entire account - let's say you did 1 contract.  That is a high probability trade that will return $270 (27%) on one trade alone.***

Your goal should be to find trades like these and slowly build up your account each week.  It requires a lot more patience, but each week should start with a higher total than the previous one.  As you begin to build the account, the number of trades (and flexibility) also increases as well.

As I mentioned, at some point I will do the $5K challenge as well, but until then I wanted to give you some tips.

Best, H.S.
