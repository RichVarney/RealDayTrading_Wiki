It has been an interesting journey.  Attempting to find a method that can *consistently* produce profitable results for small balance accounts has never been done before and I can see why it hasn't. 

Obviously the PDT rules themselves are restrictive, as are cash-only accounts but the most restrictive thing of all is actually the....lack of cash itself.  Money makes money, always has.  It allows for flexibility, a wider array of actions one can take while trading (e.g. I can sell Puts on TSLA, I can buy calls on AMZN, buying back short options is never an issue, etc...)  Hence the point of this entire experiment - to level the playing field.

One of the bigger issues is that it is cost-prohibitive to buy *stock* in an account that has $5,000, which pushes traders towards options.  Options however have a ticking clock, and given the lack of financial resources traders of these account typically buy options that expire the same week.  *This gives trades very little room to breathe*.  Even a cursory analysis of the $5K journal reveals that a vast majority of the trades would have worked given additional time.   

My key findings so far:

1) *One can only take the top tier set-ups.*  Out of roughly 20-30 potentially good set-ups each day, only 1 or 2 would be considered "excellent".  I found this early quite early on, the trick was - *identifying those trades.*

2) Those top set-ups are absolutely centered on breaches of an Algo Price Point (see previous post for the remaining open questions on this strategy) which are in the same direction as the market.  **Note:** While it is assumed that these breaks of the Algo PP's encompass *relative strength/relative weakness* it is important to verify.  These need to become the alerts that are set on your charts. The distinguishing factor that makes one Algo PP breach better than another is the quality of the Daily chart and the Relative Volume.

3) Looking through the Trading Journal it is also clear that the best *type* of trade to use is either a straight Call or straight Put that has a Delta of .65 or higher and *expires more than 1 week out*.

That presents us with a very straight-forward strategy to now try going forward:

Only take trades that show a clear ALGO PP breach in the same direction of the market, with strong volume, a good daily chart, and has RS or RW.  Use ITM Calls or Puts (.65 or higher) that expire more than one week out.

So that is what we will do - each day I will buy either a Call or a Put that meet the criteria above on the top 1-3 trades.  

While this strategy can work in a Cash account, I am keeping it margin for the moment as this continues to be an experiment.  Once the method(s) have been shown to produce consistently profitable results for accounts under $25K, I will lock it in, put it in the Wiki and include the full recommendations.  

I would say **BA** trade made today (182.5 Call for 4/22) would be the first of these as it checks all the boxes, including the breach of the Algo price point of $176.75, but given that it is an ATM call it does not quite qualify.  

So starting tomorrow I will close out of all positions, give an update as to the account and begin with this new strategy.

 

Best, H.S.
