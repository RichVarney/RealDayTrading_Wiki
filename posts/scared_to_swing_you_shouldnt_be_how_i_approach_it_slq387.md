When I first learned about day trading, one of the things that drew me to it was being able to close down for the day with no open trades, no exposure to the market. Sounds great, and stress free, right?

So, when I read many of u/HSeldon2020’s post where swing trading kept coming up again and again, my thoughts were along the lines of *“Yeah, but I don’t have to. I can just day trade and close them down at the end of the day, then completely disconnect from the market”.* And I was right – I could.

But by doing so, I was severely limiting both my development as a trader and my P&L. It took me awhile to learn this, and so I am posting this in the hopes that others in this community can go through this part of the learning curve faster by leveraging my experience. Also from a selfish perspective writing down my strategy and reflecting on individual trades further helps my development. Keep in mind that while there are many aspects to the overall strategy taught here, it can really be boiled down to three main components, with everything else feeding into them:

1. Market first – trade in the same direction as your market bias
2. Go long on stocks that have Relative Strength (RS) to ***SPY*** and short stocks that have Relative Weakness (RW) to ***SPY***
3. Go long stocks with a strong daily chart and go short stocks with a weak daily chart

If you only day trade, you miss the benefits of the daily chart. You will inevitably have to take losses on trades that would have turned out to be winners simply because of an irrational fear of overnight exposure.

In the OneOption chat room, I would often notice that I would trade the same stock as u/HSeldon2020 or u/onewyse and it would trade against me initially, and I would take the loss. The next day (or sometimes the next week), Hari and Dave were taking profits on the same stock – it was clear I was missing out. Then Hari made his post on hedging, [linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/ri3nj5/hedging/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (if you haven’t read it yet, stop reading this post and come back after you’ve read it). This really clicked for me.

Because I do not trade options, the strategy of hedging long positions on RS stocks with short positions RW stocks overnight made the most sense to me. There is also an edge in trading relative weakness, so in addition to providing a hedge, shorting these RW stocks has the ability to generate profits on its own.

So, how do I approach this in my own trading?

I generally do not open new trades after 2:30 PM (CST) or 30 minutes before the close – at this time, I shift focus to managing my existing positions and determine which ones I want to exit before the close and which ones I will swing.

I then look at the trades I am going to swing – how do those positions compare to my market bias?

Let’s say I am bullish and I have two short trades but no longs overnight, that means I would be trading against my market bias overnight which violates the “Market First” premise. So, I will either cut those positions, or more likely if I have confidence in them (after all, if I’m short, they have a weak daily chart and are RW relative to ***SPY***), then I will enter long trades to offset them and ideally tilt my portfolio slightly long since that is my market bias.

If I have four long trades on and only one short but have a neutral market bias, I would probably try to cut at least one of my long trades and add one or two more short positions to balance my portfolio. For me, I generally trade similar sized positions, but I can also enter a 1.5x or 2x sized position if that’s what needed to provide the right balance.

Let’s look at how this works in practice. Here is a view from TraderSync of all the positions I’ve swung in my day trading account since the start of the year. I only trade (open new positions) on Fridays, so you’ll see they are all opened on Fridays and then closed throughout the following week, sometimes the week after that if needed.

While this is a limited sample size, you can see win rate is 75%.

At face value this sounds solid but not great. However, if you go into the charts for these trades and compare their entry price vs. the closing price on the day they were entered, if they were all exited at the close, the **win rate would have been 25%** \- only ***OVV, CVX, FTNT, GLW*** and ***ZIM*** were in profit. And out of those five, ***OVV, CVX*** and ***FTNT*** were actually traded specifically to hedge that I entered just prior to the close– so you could argue the real win rate if these trades were exited at the close would be more like 12% (2 of 17)…

Now what does this say about my trading? Well, a couple things – some good, some bad.

On the good end – I am picking the right stocks, particularly ones with good longer term trends in the direction of my trade. Given enough time, my trades are becoming profitable and I am patient enough to realize these profits.

On the bad end, I need to improve my entries. To do so, I need to double down on my market focus and do a better job at using bullish/bearish 1OP cycles and trendline alerts to guide my entries – something I do now but can certainly improve on – but back to topic.

Let’s look at an example day. On January 21st, we had a very bearish day. All of my short positions worked really well, kept hitting profits targets, but I was still in ***PG*** & ***UNP*** long as we approached the close (despite being strong, these stocks never got going due to the market weakness). So I entered ***FTNT*** short around 2:30 PM CST, and shortly after my entry the market began to confirm my ***FTNT*** position. I spent the last 30 minutes scanning for RW stocks, and nothing was sticking out. So, I elected to add to ***FTNT*** at 2x my normal size (add to your winners), and went into the weekend short ***FTNT*** 2x size and long ***PG & UNP*** – perfectly balanced.

On Monday, the market sold off at the open and took ***FTN***T with it, and I was able to take profits on ***FTNT*** for my biggest win since starting trading. Because ***PG & UNP*** were RS, they weathered the drop very well. However, they seemingly lost RS throughout the following weak and actually lagged ***SPY*** during this recent rebound. Despite this, there was never a significant technical violation on either of the daily charts. I held both positions over the entire next week and into the next, and eventually was able to close out ***UNP*** for a win on Wednesday this week and came close to scratching ***PG***, eventually closing for a small loss.

Had I closed out these positions at the close that Friday, I would have taken +$423, -$222, -$265 on ***FTNT, PG*** and ***UNP*** respectively. Swinging ***FTNT*** short both allowed me to profit on its weak daily chart and also avoid taking premature losses in ***PG & UNP*** that turned out to be a net winning combined position.

Here are the trades (the two entries on ***FTNT*** are really close to each other):

To be fair though, you are taking more risk with this strategy. Look at ***OVV***, a position I was in profit on but kept on as a swing to balance out shorts in my portfolio. This turned into a big loser. However, when you do this, don’t focus on one trade – focus on your portfolio as a whole. ***OVV*** allowed me to stay in several underwater short positions, all of which eventually came around as winners – it was a net benefit when you consider that.

Here are the tips I would have to limit your risk:

1. Only tilt your overnight portfolio in one direction (bullish or bearish) when you have strong market conviction – otherwise try to stay balanced
2. Honor your personal risk profile and size appropriately – swing trades will move more than day trades and if you are trading too big, your emotions will take over
3. Try to hedge with similar industries if you can (for example, going long a RS financials stock to hedge your short on a RW financials stock). The reason for this is that you can avoid impacts of sector rotation in the market on your trades. For example, if you go long a RS tech stock and short a RW financials stock, and news come out over the weekend that suggests the Fed may hike rates, both positions may be underwater come Monday. Note – this strategy also works well if you want to maintain positions over FOMC events.
4. Pre-define your mental stop and only change it if market conditions warrant doing so. If your stock breaks down on the daily chart, you need to recognize this and exit. Keep your size small until you’ve proven to yourself you can take the loss on these trades.

To hold myself accountable, I'll respond to this post at the end of this week with how swinging works out for me from this past trading day. I am currently:

* Long ***AA, NET, U, CME*** (2x)
* Short ***AGNC, TXN, GILD*** (entered right before close to hedge portfolio)

Congratulations on reaching the end of my essay. Hopefully this is helpful to you, best of luck!
