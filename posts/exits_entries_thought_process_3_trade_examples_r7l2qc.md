EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

Since I am constantly asked to post about entry and exit, I figured I would use some actual trades from Friday as examples. Overall I did 24 trades that day, so these are just a sample to help illustrate the points. For each trade I will give you my thought process on the method, entry and exit:

*Even though I am on the West Coast all times will be in EST:*

**NEGG** \- 9:47am & 9:51am - off the bullish hammer and developing bull flag on the five minute chart, I went long **NEGG** at $50.80 (average price on the two trades).

*Type of Trade: Momentum - Low float:* Obviously **NEGG** is a crap stock that is way over-valued, but given the float, actual value doesn't really apply here. I liked the continuation and volume - clearly buyers were not done with this stock.

*Exit Plan:* I also had a very clear mental stop at around $50.36 (bottom of the 9:45am candle). The real question for me on this stock was - would I let it go all the way to $43.50 (the support formed on the daily chart)? I liked the volume and the bull flag on the daily chart, but I would rather treat this stock like a *scalp* than anything else, it is far too volatile. As you can see the question for me was - am I willing to take a $7 loss on this stock to see if the daily bull flag holds, or the smaller more immediate mental stop of a .50 loss? I decided I didn't trust the stock enough for the extended Stop (unlike **CARV** where I did use an extended stop down at $9.50, which worked out quite well), so I went with .50 cents - and since this stock can jump that much in a single tick, I started out with a lower number of shares. *Note: all my stops are mental stops so I can quickly adjust to the price action and the market.*

*Result:* As **NEGG** started to go up, I added shares along the way - finally averaging out to $52.78. At around 10am when I saw **NEGG** get rejected at the previous day's high, I took profits at $57.84, for $5.06 per share/over $7 win from my initial price - a great way to start the day.

**SNOW -** 11:41am - I was watching **SNOW** all morning - and even though the stock was strong, I needed confirmation that it was *strong against the market*. There was a nice steady grind up since 10:10am with decent volume, but the market was also rising at the same time and **SNOW** wasn't outpacing **SPY**. That meant if the market was to suddenly drop (not uncommon with these small low volume candles on **SPY,** it might take **SNOW** with it). Finally at around 11:40am, **SPY** pulled back and **SNOW** remained strong - which gave me the confirmation I needed, so I took the trade with **SNOW** at 261.94. **SNOW** also had an extremely bullish daily chart, with the stock going through its' SMA 200 with ease, and staying above its' 50 & 100 SMA's respectively. The Heiken Ashi candles on the daily chart also showed a nice upward continuation off the reversal from 7/7 as well. Overall, **SNOW** has a classic bullish pattern on the Daily chart.

*Type of Trade - Relative Strength - Options:* I briefly considered using a *Call Debit Spread* expiring that day for 260/265, which was going for roughly $1.90 debit at the time, but I decided against it as I did not want to cap my gains. So instead I opted for straight calls and took the 7/23 Calls - the 245 Strike for $19.90 each. The delta was .85, which meant I was getting a pretty decent 1-to-1 move with the stock.

*Exit Plan:* I wanted to see **SNOW** hold the 200 SMA at 260.09, and that gave me a clear stopping point for the trade. If I was using the stock, I would most likely have waited to see if **SNOW** was staying above the SMA 200 at the close, and if it did, I would carry through to Monday (that is the benefit of Day Trading stocks with a good daily chart, you can turn them into *swing trades* with a high degree of confidence, giving you more leeway). However, since these were Call Options and I had no intention of holding over the weekend, I was prepared to cut the trade if **SNOW** had two 5-minute candles in a row below the SMA 200. I also looked at the closing price on 3/3 of 270 as the area I would take profit (particularly if **SNOW** hit that mark and got rejected).

*Result:* I do not like to holding straight calls and puts over the weekend - it is like burning money. I sold the options when **SNOW** hit 270 (the high from 3/3) for $26.43 each, a profit of $6.53 per contract. As you can see from the chart, even though **SPY** remained unchanged from 11:40 to roughly 2pm, **SNOW** continued to increase, a major benefit to choosing stocks with *relative strength to SPY* (note: this isn't RSI or Beta).

*While I had several others good winners (including* ***SGOC***\*), those two are good examples of two different types of trades and the thought process behind each. However, this wouldn't be instructional unless I also gave an example of a failed trade.\*

**WKHS -** 1:31pm - **WKHS** seemed to be gaining strength throughout the day and filled the gap from that morning. And this is where I made several very preventable mistakes. First, I bought the stock near the HOD (High-Of-Day), at 13.13, which was moronic. I have seen **WKHS** start to run before and I was convinced, despite any reason or logic, that it was going to run again. It wasn't completely without merit, the stock had been gathering steam all day and volume was starting to build, but that is not enough to take a trade. Also the daily chart is extremely ugly on this stock - it barely got above its' SMA 50 the day before, has serious resistance right above with the SMA 100 (14.06) which caps the upside, and looks like it is forming a pretty textbook Bear Flag (on the Daily Chart).

*Type of Trade - Stupid - Stock* \- There was no reason to take this trade, none - but I was on a hot streak and I took it, which is yet another idiotic reason to do a trade.

*Exit Plan -* After I executed the trade, I immediately knew that my tolerance for it was going to be low. Two bars later it lost *Relative Strength* to **SPY** and that gave me all the excuse I needed to get out of the trade. Even without that indication of weakness, 12.95 also reflected the bottom range of the previous consolidation on the five-minute chart.

*Result* \- As I deserved, I took the loss on **WKHS** getting out at 12.94, for a loss of .19 cents a share. The damage was minimal, but this is a perfect example of a trade that might "look" good at the moment, but in retrospect, really wasn't.

These three trades, a sample from this past Friday, are meant to illustrate some of the thinking that went into each and how I planned to exit them, which I hope partly answers some of the questions around this aspect of Day Trading.
