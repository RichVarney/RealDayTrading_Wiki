If you look through your trade history and examine the losing trades you will see that there are really only three reasons why a trade goes wrong:

**1) Market Misread -** You didn't read the market correctly.  The stock was fine, the exit is fine, but the market tanked, taking the stock with it.

**2) Poor Exit**  \- This could have been a winner, but you either exited too early, or too late.

**3) Wrong Stock** \- This trade was a loser from the start.

*I don't really consider "wrong entry" a reason since with the right entry, every trade could theoretically be a winner.*

If you go through all your losing trades and label them either 1, 2, or 3 - you may see a pattern emerge which will help you get a better feel for what you need to work on moving forward.
