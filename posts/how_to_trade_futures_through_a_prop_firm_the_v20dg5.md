I am very hesitant to write this because it requires VERY careful reading and could easily be misunderstood. So please, pay very close attention to what I am trying to communicate.

First of all, this post will make no sense to you if you do not first [READ THE DAMN WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/wiki/index)

. Seriously. That is what this sub is all about and my post is only applicable to those who have really done their homework. Also, [READ MY DAMN STORY](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/umlw9x/my_story_wsb_unemployment_consistent_profitability/). Ok I probably didn't need to get so aggressive there...but yeah, reading what I have been through will give you important context to what I have to share here. Also, this isn't about actual trading strategies. If you want to learn how to trade futures, check out this [INCREDIBLE RESOURCE](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/uwgsvh/sp500_trading_curriculummega_resource/).

Ok, here goes:

**The problem with futures**

Wait....the problem? I thought this post was a case *for* trading futures. Well...if you read my story (you didn't did you?....I knew it) you would know that I am absolutely looking forward to getting over PDT and being able to day trade stocks. Ask any of the professionals in this sub and they will tell you that there is no contest between trading stocks with RS/RW and trading the market directly through index futures. RS/RW Stocks win in a landslide. They *inherently* have an edge. Futures do not.

The problem with futures are the very things that make them so attractive. They are highly leveraged, not subject to PDT, and (with many brokers) require relatively little margin. All this is a recipe for disaster as new traders pop some money in their account and give them a go. You can find yourself in a deep sea of red faster than you can blink. Really, trading these instruments should be left to the professionals...but we all know that doesn't stop anyone; underfunded beginners are constantly flocking to them (Hey I resemble that remark!)

**The problem with prop firms**

Hold on...so there's problems with futures and prop firms?! Oh man, I'm really starting to think that all of this isn't such a great idea....Well good. Maybe I can scare some of you off.

Modern Prop Firms are highly aware of the predicament I laid out in the previous section, and they have built their entire business plan around it: Futures are just too good to resist, yet they are *extremely* difficult to trade. Traders will come. They will fail. They will try again. They will fail again. The firm will collect their money.

So how does it work? I have done extensive research on all the modern firms, and their basic structure is pretty much the same:

1. ***You pay them to earn the right to a funded account.*** This is basically a paper account you trade live during market hours. You have a profit target you need to hit without going past your maximum drawdown and you pass! You can take as long as you need to complete this challenge, because your payment is monthly...and you pay more per month based on the size of account you are trying out for. This can be anywhere from $100-$600 a month. Cha-ching.
2. ***You pay them when you fail.*** If you hit your maximum drawdown, thus failing the challenge, you pay a "reset fee" if you want to keep trying. This is an additional cost on top of the monthly fee, and usually around $80. Double cha-ching.
3. ***In a funded account, you pay them a percentage of your profits.*** Most companies will let you keep 100% of the first 10k or so you earn. After that, they take anywhere from 10-30% of your profits from every withdrawal.

That structure is not really the problem. If you pass the challenge, maybe with one reset, and it takes you two months, you've spent a total of let's say $500. Now you have a 50k account where you can trade 5 /ES contracts at a time. All you would need is one 2pt winner on your max contracts and everything is paid for! And yeah, you do have to give them 10% of your withdrawals, but that is a small price to pay for the massive earning potential they are laying at your feet! 10 points a day on 5 contracts is over $500,000 a year AFTER you pay them their cut.

....Here's the thing. That's exactly what they want you to try to do. The problem is that the total buying power they give you is WAY too much for the drawdown they allow. For instance, a 50k, 5 contract account allows a max loss of around $2,000 during the challenge. If you take a position with your maximum amount of contracts, that's a loss of just 8 /ES points. You know how easy it is to loose 8 /ES points?! You make one bad trade and bam, your done. This drawdown increases as your account does, so eventually you CAN have massive earnings....but if you don't take it slow you are going to be failing a lot of challenges, starting a lot of new accounts, and putting more money in their pocket.

**THE SOLUTION!**

So, with all that said, why would I suggest that you use a prop firm to trade futures?! Because if done correctly, you can: trade futures every single day without risking your own money, have the experience of money being on the line, determine beforehand the total amount of money you loose each month, and be given the possibility of earning far more, far quicker than you ever could by trading your own capital.

Here's how:

1. Learn. If you don't know what a futures contract is, how they relate to the markets, the difference between a micro and a mini, etc etc etc. Go learn! I spent three months reading about the market, technical analysis, strategies, price action and everything else before even opening a broker account. I spent another 3 months watching the SPY chart ALL DAY. Get out there and immerse yourself. Don't think you will be able to jump right in. Again, here is THIS RESOURCE. and the DAMN WIKI. Make sure you know what you are doing and how you are going to do it.
2. Go back and do step #1, because I know you are trying to skip it.... You can't skip it, or you will not succeed!
3. When you are confident you have a grasp on the market and have a strategy that you want to try and execute, paper trade until you have 3 months with a win rate of at least 60% and a profit factor of 1.5 (this is far less than the WIKI suggests for RS/RW, but futures are f\*&$% hard and don't have the same edge, so if you are pulling these kind of stats, your doing alright).
4. Choose a prop firm. I have done extensive research on all of them and my top choice is definitely [Apex Trader Funding](https://apextraderfunding.com/member/aff/go/iamtrading?c=IAM), which is who I have an account with. [TopStep](https://www.topstep.com/) is also good. I have tried both and I can tell you they are legit. If you do decide to go with Apex, I have talked with them and you can use the code "IAM" to get the best possible deal on evaluations (sometimes up to 90% off!). (I would get a small commission from Apex, I'm not an affiliate of Topstep) (Also let me know if you would like me to do a write-up comparing and contrasting the two companies...I have done WAY too much reading and can definitely give you a solid breakdown)
5. Consider your financial situation and DECIDE BEFOREHAND the total amount of money you will pay towards prop fees every month. This needs to be money you are completely ok with never gaining back. Based on this number, choose your account size and number of monthly resets you will allow yourself. When considering account size, your thought process needs to be that you are spending more for a larger drawdown...NOT for making more money. You will be trading 1 micro at a time anyway (spoiler alert for the next rule). "Resetting" an account is not a good phycological habit to get into, so I suggest allocating your money towards a larger account (read: larger drawdown) and 1, if any, resets.  \*\*\*It is absolutely crucial these limits are UNBREAKABLE\*\*\*  If you break this rule, there is nothing stopping you from going on a "reset-tilt" and opening new account after new account. Remember, this is what they want you to do.
6. Trade 1 micro contract at a time, scaling up slowly (I added one contract every 1k). Keep careful watch of your drawdown and SCALE DOWN if you are getting close. DO NOT trade minis or try to complete the challenge by sizing up. If you fail the challenge and don't have any self-allowed resets, paper trade for the rest of the month as punishment. You will complete the challenge when you complete the challenge, but that cannot be part of your thought process. You have already determined that you are absolutely willing to pay your monthly fees, consider them your price for education (which I can promise you is FAR less than it would be if you were trying to trade your own capital). When you complete the challenge and earn a funded account, go back to 1 micro (no matter where you ended up in the scaling process) and start again.

\*\*\*edit: Many have brought up the drawdown structure. I was hoping to get into it, but it would be a whole separate article.....briefly: During the challenge phase Apex measures drawdown intra-trade and Topstep measures it at eod (unless you hit your max drawdown intraday). Therefore, yes, Topstep favors longer trend moves and Apex is more for scalpers. I scalp so it favors my style...but this structure really only comes into play more if you are sizing up too much. With small positions you can do trend moves in either.

**\*\*TLDR: Futures are hard. Prop firms take advantage of that. RS/RW is better but if you are going to trade futures, learn everything you can and scale slowly, using prop-firm's monthly fees as your non-negotiable monthly tuition.**



Best of luck, RTDW and let me know if you have any questions !
