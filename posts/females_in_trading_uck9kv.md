As we all know, becoming a full-time trader is an extremely difficult goal to achieve.  

It is so difficult that if it wasn't for the extraordinary payoff of financial independence, many people would not even attempt it.

Trading is also a *male-dominated* field, like so many in the financial realm tend to still be, even in today's supposed *enlightened* environment. In essence, women have been shut out.  

Videos on YouTube are filled with images of what society deems as "masculine success", made complete by the ever-present gaudy Lambo.  

Online conversation, while I wouldn't describe it as "locker room talk" is certainly male-centric, and filled with exactly the kind of vernacular you would expect from a community that is most likely over 90% skewed toward men.

And despite all the social progress that has been made (and there has been some), women continued to be steered away from finances from a young age.  When the culture is combined with an uninviting environment, it begins to make sense why trading is so male dominated.

In fact, many women that do enter the space use gender-neural screen names out of fear of being treated differently.

No matter how you look at it, the world of "trading" is not one that is welcoming to women.   

And yet, the trading is the one place where there is no gender gap in pay.  The market will take or pay your money just as equally - it is truly one of the only egalitarian fields out there to work.   Success or failure is so gender ambivalent that one would think the level playing field makes it a perfect career choice for women, but it isn't.

When I said I wanted to change the way trading was viewed and turn it into a viable career choice, I meant for everyone.  As part of that mission (and as many of you know),  I am currently in the process of having a fully produced show put together.  And to help make trading a more viable choice for females, I am planning for the format to feature segments on women in trading, .  However, having a male (me) sit there and talk to women about trading, just perpetuates the very problem I am talking about, and that is not what I want.

So I would love to know if there are any female traders that would be interested in coming on the show (think Summer 2022) to talk about your experience?  

If so, let me know! 

Best, H.S.
