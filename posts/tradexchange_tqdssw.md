For those interested in the Link that Hari posted on Sunday, here are a couple of trades I took due to Tradexchange today.

**03/28/2022 12:45:47 PMTX-News:** **NEGG vol pop** 

bought at $5.80 on the mention sold for +.50

**03/28/2022 09:41:30 AMTX-News2:** **HYMC vol**

Bought at $2.00 sold at $2.15

**03/28/2022 09:30:59 AMTX-News:** **DATS small pop at open following PM headlines** 

bought at $2.22 now at 3.12

Just wanted to give you a few examples, besides the news feed that you receive.

And yes, most of these are low float stocks on huge volume (so trade at your own risk).  I mostly scalp these occasionally.  I use Tradexchange for the pertinent headlines, but this along with upgrade/downgrades, Sec filings etc. is just another feature.

TIP:   I like using the search function on any stock that I maybe trading to see if any of the movement is driven by recent news. This is alone is worth the price of admissions for me.

here is the link for the discount if interested:
