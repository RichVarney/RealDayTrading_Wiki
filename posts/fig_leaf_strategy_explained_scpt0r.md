This doesn't fit "Day Trading", but it does qualify as "Swing Trading" and a lot of you have asked for an explanation. 

Essentially this is a *Leveraged Covered Call*.  

If you were simply executing *Covered Calls* you would be selling an OTM Call on your current holdings.  So if you held 100 shares of AAPL, you would be able to sell a 170 call against those 100 shares and receive a $65 credit (*note: prices are currently inflated due to upcoming earnings, and you should not do either the* ***Fig Leaf*** *or* ***Covered Calls*** *that cross over an earnings date).*

If by the end of the week AAPL finishes below 170, you keep the entire $65 in credit.  If AAPL finished at $171, you would get the $11.22 increase in the stock price from your 100 shares (so $112.22), plus the $65 from the call you sold, but you would have to sell your shares at that $170 price to whomever holds the call you sold.  You would not get the additional $1 increase (from $170 to $171).

**Fig Leafs** are a bit different - it entails the following:

1) Buy a LEAP call (which by definition means it is at least a year out from the current date but some use 6-month mini LEAPS) on a stock you have a long-term Bullish outlook that has a Delta of .75 or higher.  For example, **NVDA** \- the 150 Calls that expire in January 2023, currently have a Delta of .78 and are going for roughly $82 (or $8,200).  $73 of that price is in *intrinsic value* since **NVDA** is currently at $223.24 and that price minus the strike of $150 equals $73.  Which means you are paying $9 (or $900 in premium).

2) Each week sell a call with a Delta of .10 or lower against that LEAP.  Thus, for this week on Monday you could have gotten the $250 Strike calls that expire Friday for a credit of around $150.

3) If **NVDA** finishes the week below $250, you keep the $150 and do the same thing the following week.

4) If **NVDA** finishes the week above $250 at let's say $255, your January 2023 call will have increased in value by roughly $25 (or $2,500).  Your broker will auto-execute the trade by activating the January 2023 call, meaning you buy 100 shares of **NVDA** at $150, and then sell those calls to the owner of the $250 call you sold them for $250 (check with them).  You will get $10K for that sale, minus the $8,200 it cost for the LEAP and plus the $150 in credit for the call you sold - you profit, $1,950.  And then do it again the next week by buying another LEAP.

5) After receiving over $900 in Premium from your *covered calls* you sold each week (roughly 6 weeks), you have now covered the cost of your *LEAP* and own it free and clear.  You can continue to profit from it through more *covered calls* or hold it and let it increase (*hopefully*) in value.

*Sounds too good to be true, right?*

**Here is the danger - if the stock drops significantly, while you will collect the premium each week from your short calls it won't be enough to cover the loss in value from the LEAP call which will be dropping with the stock.** 

**However, since the LEAP is a year out, you can weather most drops, as long as it isn't a technical breach.**

It is best to wait for SPY to breakdown (like it currently is), then wait for it find support (jury is still out as to whether it did, but we will know soon enough), and then enter into various **Fig Leafs** across different sectors.  So you wouldn't want to do both **AAPL** and **MSFT**, you would want something like **NVDA, HD, MRNA, AMZN** \- stocks that have a lot of premium from IV are best.  

Obviously the more LEAPS you buy the more calls you can sell.  If you buy two **NVDA** Leaps you can sell 2 OTM **NVDA** calls each week.

Cheaper stocks like **PFE** may be more stable, but that very stability means you will not be getting much from selling those calls each week.

If you find that you have a lot of bullish exposure through these, then you can buy insurance - grab something like **SPY** $350 Puts that expire January 2023 for $16, or **VXX** $15 Calls that expire January 2023 for $12.  

I hope this helps explain the strategy!

 

Best, H.S.
