This past week a very unfamiliar feeling washed over me while trading - *I was worried*.   Now you might scoff at that as for many traders "worry" is just a constant state of being.   But I can't remember the last time I was actually "worried" while trading, but I do know it's been years.

I have made a lot of money trading (*if not I definitely shouldn't be running this sub*), and it would take many losing months in a row to give all that back, at least a year straight of nothing but Red.  

Still - last week at this time, I broke one of my primary rules.  I was *so convinced* of my thesis and so annoyed that the market was going up, I kept increasing my short position.  At first it was just another **SPY Leap** here or some more shares of **AAPL** short there, but that wasn't enough - so I began adding even more.  The market is screaming higher, you all remember it, right? **SPY** was a non-stop Bullish train.  But I refused to believe it.  Screw the market - I have my damn thesis and I am right!  Technical analysis went out the window as well - my thesis overrode that silly TA!

Yeah - as bad as that sounds, it was even worse.   By the time the closing bell rang on Friday I was down - **a lot**.  Just so you get a sense of it - before Monday morning I was well over six-figures in the red.  

And here is the rule I broke - *Never trade emotionally*.  I might be wrong at times, I might misread something, but I never enter or exit a trade because I am afraid.  

We can say - *Don't trade your P&L* all day long, but we all know if you have a large position, and it is down, that you are thinking about how much you are losing.  

On top of that I had just told a few thousand people that I believed the market was going down and instead it started an insane bullish run!  Yeah - needless to say I was not happy at all.  Still convinced my thesis was right, but not happy.

Over the weekend I start thinking - "*The damn thing HAS to open down on Monday!"*.  And of course, Monday comes and not only does it not open in the red, but the little bastard goes up even more! Throwing my monitor out the window was a serious option.

At this point I start thinking about exactly how *long-term* I am willing to shoulder these shorts.  Because even after Monday's bullish result, I am still confident that **SPY** is going to revisit the low of the year. There is either something very admirable in sticking to one's thesis like that or something very stubborn and stupid.  Probably both.

I knew if the **CPI** came in as expected we would drop given that it was priced in, so a "sell the news" reaction would occur.  It wouldn't drop enough, but as long as it got below the SMA's it would reverse the trend.  Obviously if the number came in worse the drop would be severe.  Although to be honest, I did not expect the number to come in hot. 

So the only thing I had to worry about is if the number came in better than expected.   

Now it is important to note that even if the CPI was better than expected my outlook would have remained bearish.  I still feel the impacts of Quantitative Tightening haven't been truly felt and also that a good **CPI** number would start pricing in a .5 rate hike with a FED that is determined to go .75 no matter what.  So once again the question was - how long am I willing to hold?

And there was my real problem - if I had a normal position size the answer to that would have been - Until I no longer held my Bearish Thesis. But I did not have a normal position size, did I? No, I did not. Because I am a dumb-ass.   This put me in the position of knowing that if the market continued up I would have to close down, or significantly reduce my positions.  Solely because I no longer was willing to withstand further losses. 

**I have gone years trading without fear, years where every decision, right or wrong, was based on a defensible argument.  And now I put myself in a position where my emotions are deciding my exits.**

I had pretty much forgotten what that is like to trade like that - ***It is impossible***.  

One cannot trade in a state of worry, and be consistently profitable - there is no way. 

And then it occurred to me that this is the emotion that so many of you feel. Whether you are trading with money you can't afford to lose, or you took too big of a position and it went against you.  

Let me emphasize this: ***If you trade out of fear there is absolutely no way you can be profitable***.

I did this **one time** and it absolutely screwed up my entire mindset.  **One time** in over six years.  I can't imagine trading like that every day.  But some of you do.  

If you are trading with money you can't afford to lose then park that money somewhere with low-risk, and learn how to trade using paper trading.  If your position sizes are too large, you are most likely looking for *big wins* and need to change your mindset (I have several posts on this in the *Wiki*). 

One thing is certain - you need to find a way to trade without that fear hanging over your head.  **It is essential.**

Did I wind up being right? Making a profit?  Yes - I did.  But that is besides the point.  Because what if that CPI number came in cold?  I would have had to make a choice, and I know what choice I would have made - the wrong one. And why? Because of fear.  And that cannot stand.  

 

Best, H.S.
