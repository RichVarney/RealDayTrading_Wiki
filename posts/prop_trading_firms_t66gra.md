Just a quick note on this.  

Every week around 5 to 10 traders ask me about joining a prop trading firm.  Some of them are really excited about it, telling me about all the amazing things they get once they join.  A fully funded account! No more PDT! Trade your own style!

Take a moment and think about it.  Why? Why would anyone give you that?

Just remove ego out of the equation for a second.  Here you are - you know the basics of trading, but you have never had a profitable month, let alone several in a row.  The best you have managed has been a few really good days, but overall, that account is in the red.  So much that I bet you don't even want to look at the total.  

Now think as if you were a "Prop Trading Firm",  would you want to hire a bunch of people like yourself??  No, of course not.

***Unless***.....you charged them for the opportunity to try, right?  Because everyone a) *wants to be evaluated and see how good they really are* and *b) thinks they can pass*.  And once they pass, *then* they can share in the big pool of money, right?  No, of course not.  That is recipe for disaster - you wouldn't let a bunch of strangers just trade all your money!

Because....once the 1 out of every 50 that manage to "graduate" (naturally you keep the entry fees from the other 49, but hey, they can come back and keep trying!) and get a "desk", they don't get the full $25,000/$50,000/$100,000/etc.  Nope.  They will trade a small portion of the total pool of money, and with very tight restrictions on it.  But that's ok, they will be fine with it....why, because.....

Always being dangled in front of them is a way to **move up** and really cash in....I mean look, there goes Michelle now, new Ferrari and everything....Michelle is one of our "Platinum Traders" she has access to the full $100,000.  Keep trying, you will get there one day!  Michelle managed it in six months, a new company record!  

Getting the picture?  

***It is a pretty simple concept - anyone good enough to be a prop trader doesn't need to be a prop trader.***
