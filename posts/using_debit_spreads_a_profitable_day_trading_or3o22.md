Many traders trade debit spreads but generally using expiration dates a few weeks or more in the future.

There is a very effective strategy for trading debit spreads using the current weeks expiration.

There are just a few criteria that need to be followed to make the debit spreads a profitable strategy for day trading.

For call debit spreads the stock selected must have relative strength versus the SPY on a 5 min basis (this is not RSI but a stock that outperforming the SPY index on a 5 min basis)

Stock should be bullish technically on the daily chart

Buy a call close to at the money or slightly in the money and sell a higher strike call and the spread MUST be purchased for less than 50% of the spread. IE a spread with a $5 spread should be bought for less than $2.50 per spread contract, the lower the better.

Immediately place a sell order for a profit of from 10% to 50% depending on the number of days to expiration. On monday and tuesday 10% to 20% is reasonable and scale the profit target up the closer to friday the trade is put on.

This strategy can be used on some stocks with fairly wide bid ask spreads (such as AMZN GOOGL TSLA etc)

Because of the structure of the spread the downside risk is mitigated by having a short call that will time decay faster than the long call thus a sideways move will reduce the premium on the short call faster than on the long call. Because of this it allows you to stay in the trade longer than if you were using straight calls.

You are capping your profits if the stock goes parabolic but this s more than offset by the % of times you will be profitable on marginal stock moves.

Put debit spreads work the same except for the stock setup has to be bearish

If you try this strategy use 1 or 2 contracts until you are comfortable with the strategy.

Remember, to be a successful and consistently profitable trader you need to have several strategies in your tool belt and must always be aware of the market movement at all times and use that as a guide as to when to enter any strategy you use.
