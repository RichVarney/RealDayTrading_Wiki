In a bullish market, which despite current circumstances we are still in, roughly 99% of your long trades will eventually be profitable - given enough time.

Obviously I am not talking about low-float low cost crappy stocks that gap up and you grab for $6.75 only to realize that is probably the last time that stock will ever see that price again (that is until you sell it at $3.60 and the next day watch it run it to $12...).  I am talking about the stocks we all know and love, the AAPL's, HD's, etc.  

Only a major negative change in the company, like we saw with **PTON** will drop a stock beyond repairable levels.  

Think about it - what are the odds you bought a stock at the exact moment it will start to drop for the rest of its life on the exchange?  I could buy **AAPL** right now at $162.41, and even though it might drop - at some point it will eventually be over that price again.  The entire concept of *Long Term Investing* is based on this and *this is the benefit of a bull market*.  

The only question is time.  Let's say I bought **AAPL** and the market starts to really crash, **AAPL** could continue to drop, all the way down to $100 perhaps - but I would know that if I just held it, maybe for a year, maybe 2, hell, maybe 10, it will eventually get above that price.

Since we are short-term traders we have don't have luxury to wait 10 years, we need those moves to happen quickly.  So we use technical analysis to help increase the odds that the trade will go in our favor.  

Let's say our maximum time horizon for holding a trade is *one month* \- now clearly the percent of stocks that will eventually go above our entry price *within a month* is less than the 99% you get for waiting a lifetime.  However, because you should be choosing stock with strong daily charts and Relative Strength, the odds are still *very* high - most likely still over 90% in fact.

And now you see the power and danger of options - Options give you incredible leverage.  You can benefit from **TSLA** moving up $50 in a day, without having to own 100 shares of **TSLA**.  That is a *huge* advantage.  But the trade-off is time.   Now there is a time-limit on how long you can wait for the stock to turn around.  And every day you wait, the value of that options drops from *time-decay*.  

The moment you buy an option you are starting a clock, and that is how long you have to get into profit.  Whereas with stock, there is no clock, but there is the restriction on buying power.

So that's the trade off - time vs. buying power.  

Let's say on Monday the market turns bullish and by Tuesday I am convinced it found support.  Let's also say I have $10,000 in my account, with $20,000 in stock buying power (because in this example I am using margin like you all should be).  I like **AAPL** which is now at $165 and rising, so now I have two choices:

I can buy 100 shares of **AAPL** for $16,500 pretty much wiping out my buying power completely or I can buy 5 In-The-Money Options that expire in two-weeks for $7 each, costing me $3,500, leaving me plenty left over to still make other trades.

And then - BAM - it was a headfake, the market heads back down towards the SMA 200, taking **AAPL** with it - 

If I bought the 100 shares of stock, and **AAPL** dropped $5 in price, I would be down $500 - and I could just hold the stock until it rebounds, which it eventually will.  But my buying power will still be tied up.

If I bought the 5 Call Options, they would be down about $4, losing 80% of their value - and I would not have much time to wait it out, plus I would have lost roughly $2,000.  Still, I would be left with plenty of money to make trades.

See the trade-offs here?

This is one of the major benefits larger accounts have - they can buy the stock instead of the options without worrying about the impact on buying power.  

When you buy straight calls or puts you want *immediate* movement in the direction of your trade.  The appeal of using *spreads* is that you time does not hurt you as much (and in some cases helps you) as it does with straight options.   

That is why the decision between stocks and options really all comes down to a matter of time and how long you are willing and able to hold a position. 

The next reason has to do with IV - 

*When you buy an option you want to pay as little as possible in premium and when you sell one you want to receive as much as possible in premium.*

However, market makers and their algos are *very smart*.  If an option is cheap, meaning you aren't paying much in premium for it (remember it is (Stock Price - Strike Price) - Price of Option, for in the money options) there is usually a reason.  That reason is the lack of expectation that the stock is going to make a significant move in either direction. 

Right now VXX remains somewhat low (VXX is your indicator for Option Premiums), despite the heavy selling pressure - which make straight Puts more attractive.  When the market finds support and gets bullish, straight calls will become very popular.  

For example - right now if I were to buy the $150 strike calls for AAPL it would cost me around $13.41 (really it's $13.50 but you'll see why I am using $13.41).  So lets plug into that equation above - Stock Price is $162.41 - Strike Price of $150 = $12.41.  $12.41 - Option Price of $13.41 = -$1  I am paying $1 in premium for that Call.  If I looked at the percent of the price that is premium it is $1/$13.41 = 7.5%.

But what if I were to go out to Feb 11th expiration? Now the same option is roughly $14.41 or $2 in premium - which is paying 13.8%.  

So now you have two things going against you - *time* and the stock needs to go up enough to cover the premium you are paying before you are in profit.  And the longer it takes to make that move, the more it has to go up due to *time-decay.*  

Now your decision comes down to the attributes of the stock itself - if I am looking at stocks that are tied to sector rotation (meaning sometimes the sector, like energy, is hot and sometimes it goes cold), I may not use Options because I won't be able to weather the wait for the sector to rotate back into favor again.  

But let's face it - the reason most of you are using Options is - **price**.  If wasn't for Options some of you wouldn't be able to play **TSLA (**as an example) at all.  

In the end - if you had an account with a billion dollars in it, you wouldn't mess with Options at all - you wouldn't need to, so the decision on whether to use Options or Stock now comes down to two things:

\- *Time*

\- *Money*

I currently have 750 shares of **NFLX** at a price of $425ish, because a) I feel it will go above that level at some point, and b) I can afford to wait for it to happen.  If I was using Options I wouldn't have the luxury of the second point and likely be screwed. Hence, why I chose shares.

The decision you make must take those two factors into account - if I didn't have the account size to handle those **NFLX** shares, even though I feel it will go up, I wouldn't have bought Options because I do not know *when* it will go up.  

Look at a stock like **NRG**, right now it is at $39.19 - and one of the few stocks that went up on Friday.  However, despite its' current strength the daily chart remains very weak.  If you bought Options and on Monday the stock took a downturn, you do not have the daily chart to lean on to wait it out - thus, your Options would be sold for a loss.  But you if you had the stock you could hold.

However, a stock like **WELL** which at $87.51 is above all its' SMA's , showed great strength on Friday, and did not break consolidation to the downside, in fact it went up - might be a great stock to hold Call Options for right now.

As you can see, three different stocks, three different calculations on whether to use Options or Stocks.

Hope this helps! 

Best, H.S.
