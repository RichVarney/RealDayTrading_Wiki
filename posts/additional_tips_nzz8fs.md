In the past I have posted various tips and strategies to help one in their Day Trading.   

I honestly believe in giving back to a community that you have prospered in - so that is the only reason I am here.  This is a hard field to get into and a difficult journey for most.  The reward at the end is definitely worth it, but the road there is filled with scams, pitfalls, losses and frustration.  If I can help any of you avoid some of what I and others had to face, I am happy to assist.

Also please know that while there are resources I recommend, I do not benefit or work for any service, channel or platform.  My recommendations are my personal opinion based on what I have experienced, nothing more. I detest scams and hate the schills pushing those scams even more.  I am an independent trader who trades with my own money.

Hopefully some of you were able to get in on WOOF, AAPL, DOCU and ROKU longs today, or WYNN, FCX and CLX shorts.  They all followed Relative Strength and Weakness against SPY strategy and were slam-dunk trades.

OK - some other tips in addition to those I already posted:

**1) Don't Trade Your P&L, Trade the Charts** \- When it comes to the question of "When should I exit?" your answer should be - based on the charts, not how much you are up or down on the trade.  You never want to be making decisions out of fear of loss or greed.  I exit a trade when the logic behind originally taking the trade no longer applies.  Stocks will retrace but as long as it doesn't violate the why you got into the trade to begin with, there usually isn't a good reason to exit other than watching your P&L.  Exit based on the technicals and you will find your win rate increase dramatically.

**2) Focus on Win Rate -** Yes, I know the argument - one can have a 95% win rate and still lose money if they blow it all on that 5%.  However, this should not happen if you are applying the same rules to every trade.  When your strategy isn't working and you exit, the loss should not be so much that it overcomes many wins.  The most important thing you can do is have a solid strategy that maintains a win rate of 80%.  The best way to get to that point, no matter how much is in your account, is to practice your strategy with a very small position size, I am talking only a few shares, one contract on options, etc.  (this will also help you practice not focusing on the P&L).  Do not increase your position size until you get that win rate up to that 80% mark.

**3) Don't Over-Complicate Things -** I have seen some setups where people have tons of indicators on their charts, lines are everywhere, clouds and Fibs, and then underneath is a constant stream of lines crossing each other all over the damn place.  Keep it clean.  I have SMA 50,100,200 and VWAP.  I look at the True Strength Index and Relative Strength vs SPY.  If I am scalping I will put the 3/8 EMA's up for the 1 Min charts.  Technical Analysis is great, but with enough indicators you can convince yourself of anything, "There is an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the 4 hour chart, with the RSI saying it is oversold and a MACD cross!"  You don't want to search for facts to confirm your theory, and having too many indicators lets you do just that.

**4) Momentum Trading - Fun and Dangerous -** Yeah, we all love momentum trading.  Watching a stock go from $6 to $7.50 in the span of 10 minutes.  And then you wait for your pullback, jump in around $7.10, and proceed to watch it drop all the way back down to $6 because nobody ever wants to exit a momentum trade.  You always think the next burst is one candle away.   You know what does work?  Around 90 minutes into trading today I notice that AAPL $129.24 after it already jumped up on the open.  I also notice that SPY was dropping and AAPL wasn't.  I went long AAPL at this point and stayed long, all the way to $130.30 which happened right before close.  Was it as exciting as watching GRAY go from $6.50 to $8.50 after-hours last week? No.  But I will take the AAPL trade every time. Because the AAPL trade will pay off almost every time.

**5) Trading Doesn't Stop When The Market Closes -** You should be looking through your trades for the day, analyzing what went wrong and what went right.  Looking at the chart and putting alert lines on various stocks you are watching for tomorrow.  Creating watchlists and doing overall market analysis.  Day Trading is a full-time job.  

**6) Stop Rushing Into Trades -** Yes, I know it is Day Trading and you don't want to miss the move.  But you need to take a breath.  Look at the charts, where is support? where is resistance? Are there a lot of bag holders right above this price? How does the daily chart look? Is the relative volume over 1.5? Is it strong/weak against the market?  What is your best play, stock? options? a spread?  Yeah, it takes time to do this, and with experience it will take less time, but you can't simply say - SRNE is moving I am going long and then jump in.  Know what price you want to get it at, and what price your target is, then rely on the charts to get you to your goal.

**7) Careful Following Trades -** When you follow someone else into a trade without knowing what their strategy is you may find yourself stuck well after they have already exited.  People tend to post their trades pretty quickly, but generally post their exits well after the fact.  If you are relying on someone else for your trades, make sure you have your own exit strategy.

Seven tips seems like enough for a Monday. 

Keep in mind, everything I tell you and post is geared towards one thing - becoming a consistently profitable Day Trader.  That is the goal.  There is shortcuts to it, no version of it where you trade for the first hour and then go about your day (yes, there are people who do that, even some that do it successfully, but the odds are stacked against you if that is your plan).  This is about knowing you will have between $X and $X dollars of profit at the end of every month that you can pay yourself as a salary.  And that years from now, you will still have that.  

I plan on posting about Day Trading Options next.  As always, happy to answer any questions.  I also want to thank everyone for their messages and questions, I try to get to them all, it just takes some time.
