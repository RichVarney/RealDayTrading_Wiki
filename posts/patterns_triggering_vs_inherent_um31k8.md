I have noticed that many traders are not differentiating the crucial difference between the two types of Patterns/Trendlines on charts.

The first is **Triggering**, and no, not in a "Show me on the doll..." kind of way, but rather due to a *group consensus* kind of way*.*   

Let's look at **ADBE** \-

**ADBE** has a long standing ALGO line that is descending support which began almost a year ago.  This type of line is *Triggering*.  Chances are many other traders and more importantly, Institutions, also have this very line drawn - meaning that when it is breached it becomes a clear *sell* signal.  Falling below this line gives a good set-up for a *Short* position in the stock.  

Whereas in the case of **CPB** today:

This is a 5-minute Trendline that shows....the break of a trend, that is all.  Drawing trendline intraday can be used the same way you would use a 3/8 Cross of the EMA - simply to alert you if the price of the stock is trending in the direction you want.  It is useful on a short-term time frame, as you can see above, it would have given you around 25 cents profit on a bullish trade.  However, HA Reversals/Continuation (excellent post by u/onewyse ) are, in my opinion much better at identifying those trends.  

It is very important that you recognize the difference between these as one is dependent on others recognizing the pattern and acting on it, and the other is like a temperature reading of the stock.
