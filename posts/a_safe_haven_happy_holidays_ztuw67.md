In the past year this sub has grown exponentially - putting us now in the top 5% of all sub-Reddits.  So thank you all for contributing to our success!

When this forum was started there was always the fear that as we grew the culture would begin to resemble that of other trading subs, which was the last thing we wanted.  Most other subs are a toxic mix of Trolls and well-meaning idiots. They not only suck, but they are dangerous.  People go into those communities looking for guidance and wind up getting sucked into a never-ending barrage of bad advice. 

We never wanted that for this place and thanks to our incredible team of Mods we have been able to stand strong, and remain just as cultish as ever! (yes, I am aware of the comments out there referring to us as a cult, and to that I say - You can't call us a cult until we have a commune to live on! And we won't have a commune until at least 2024!).

To put simply, I want this to be a place that is life-changing to those that embrace it.  Of course our ultimate goal is to help people obtain financial freedom and become full-time traders, but as many of you know, it is the journey towards that end which is truly, transformative.

And while this sub has also has a reputation of "tough love", we truly are a community in every sense of the word.  Spend some time here and you will see member after member come through the other side of that journey to start their new careers as traders.  Then you will see something even more amazing - they don't leave once reaching their goal - instead they stay and dedicate their time/experience to helping others.   

I also see amazing traders like u/optionstalker and u/onewyse work tirelessly to provide people with the tools and knowledge they need to never again have to depend on a paycheck from some company that is always a "budget cut" away from letting them go.  

In a space littered with con-artists, bad advice and cynics, my goal has always been to rebuild this field into one that gives people realistic goals, clear steps on how to reach them and support along the way.  

Also, as many now realize, trading is 90% mindset.  The methods and strategies taught here are essential, but without the right mindset they will never produce consistent profits.  A large portion of the Wiki and this community in general is dedicate towards helping people readjust their mindset, which is no simple task.  

It should come as no surprise that a vast majority of "New Years Resolutions" wind up failing. Gym Memberships soar right after January 1st and most people never use them (which is exactly what those establishments count on btw).  Time and again people vow to improve their lives as the year starts only to quickly slide back into the habits they wind up regretting.   I am sure that just about everyone reading this is intimately familiar with this phenomenon.  You didn't lose the weight, quit that job, leave that partner....we don't drink less, we never learn that new language, and the farthest you wind up travelling is to the local store.  It's a well-meaning tradition but one that leave most people feeling like shit in the end.   So why am I bringing this up without any segue at all?  

Good question - chalk it up to bad writing.  Still....allow me to tie all together.  

How many times have you started the week thinking, "Ok...I know what I have been doing wrong.  From here on I am not going to make the same mistakes!"  And how many times have you finished the week thinking, "God damnit! What the hell is wrong with me?? Why can't I stop making stupid trades??"

It is the same concept, same issue.  Just like with your NYE resolutions, the issue is that the person trying to improve themselves is the same person that caused the problems needing improvement.  And yet, *you're the only one that can solve them*. Seems like a Catch-22, right?  

**You** are the problem, but only **you** can solve it.  

Simply having the intention or desire to change is not enough, nor is knowing exactly what needs to be changed.  In order to truly change, one has to figure out what caused their issues to begin with and address it at its core. 

As a fictional example - let's say a young woman named Heather started trading but quickly realized that she always takes profit too quickly.  It's almost like an impulse - when her position turns green her immediate thought isn't, "I should let this run" or even, "I need to add to this", instead it is, "I have to take profit before I lose it!"   

Heather knows she is fucking up and even worse, she can't seem to let go of her losing positions either.  She is experiencing what most traders deal with, having more faith in her losers than her winners.

Sadly, no matter how many times Heather absolutely swears to change, she goes right back to the old habits.  

Why Heather, why? 

A quick glimpse into Heather life would give the answer (and also probably feel very familiar to many of you) - 

\- When she was 8, everything was great - Mom and Dad were there, lots of fun memories....that is until one day Dad up and left.  And therein is the first life introduction into the mental state of - "Don't trust anything that is good, because it will soon be gone."

\- Through High School and College every girlfriend Heather had (see how woke I am?) either cheated or broke up with her, usually right when she thought everything was going great.

\- She thought she would get that promotion at work, but instead they gave it to that asshole Ethan. Fuck Ethan.  

\- Heather did not have to worry about Ethan for long though, because she was laid off a few months later.

And now Heather is a single mom with a dead-end job in an Accounting office that she hates.  She is absolutely conditioned to believe that whenever something good happens, that the other shoe will soon drop.  

Now look at her propensity for taking profits quickly through that lens and you will see the *real problem*.  That is why declarations and promises to change won't make a dent in the behavior until Heather deals with the underlying issue.

Becoming a full-time trader is like a non-stop self-help seminar.  

This is even more difficult for those among us that live with mental illness. As many of you know, I have battled mental illness most of my life.  It has taken several close members of my family and will most likely continue to plague anyone unlucky enough to share genetics with my family tree. 

So many of you silently suffer from mental illness even as you try to take on something so strenuous as becoming a full-time trader.  I commend your courage.  And I hope this community provides the support you need to achieve your goals and not let anything stand in your way, including your own mind.

It is so important that this place always stays a - "community".  Call it cult, call it whatever you want - as long as the members here are not only dedicating to making their lives better but also in helping others do the same.  You never know what someone else is going through. 

RealDayTrading should always be a safe haven for anyone looking to make a better life for themselves.  And in this world right now, those are far and few between - so please, always keep this place special. And this holiday season I am very thankful for all of you helping do exactly that.

Best, H.S.
