When I first joined Real Day Trading, one of the first posts that I made was sharing my [Trading Business Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/qa86fm/trading_business_plan/). This was 7 months ago. At the time, I was very early into my trading journey, and since then, I have completed my 4 month paper trading period and transitioned into trading with real money in late February of this year. I also started out trading stock only, and have since added options and futures to my trading, though over 90% of my trades are still stock trades. 

Most importantly, I've realized the incredible importance of mindset and mental discipline in trading. My original trading plan barely touched on this. To address the expanded nature of my trading, and to put what I've learned from Hari, the Featured Traders at One Option, the Intermediate (and all the developing traders that maybe don't have the tag yet), and "The Daily Trading Coach" book that I just finished reading ([here's a link to my summary of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/v0lbgo/the_daily_trading_coach_my_notes/)), I needed to update my business plan. 

So, I took advantage of the long weekend and made the needed updates. As with the original plan, I wanted to share it with the sub-reddit. As I caveated with the original plan, I'll also warn that this is extremely long - posting partially for my own benefit to help hold myself accountable to it, but welcome any feedback and if you think it's useful, feel free to steal for yourself. 

I would also add that while I said the same thing on my original plan (it being long) - I still found it to be inadequate with key areas missing. If you don't have a documented plan, how are you holding yourself accountable? What are your goals? How often do they change? I strongly believe that you need to treat trading as a business to be successful, and encourage you to make a plan if you don't have one.

#### Part I: Overarching Framework and Plan

**Trading Vision:**

By February 2022, I will begin live trading after having established a successful, consistent, winning trading strategy that has been tested through extensive paper trading efforts. **This phase is now in progress.**

By February 2025, I will have sufficiently consistent and profitable results from live trading over the past 3 years to facilitate the transition into full-time occupation as a professional trader. These results will generate on average at least $1,500 per trading day, or roughly $350,000 on an annual basis if executed on a full-time basis.

Why? Because I do not want to constrain my life by working for a company. Professional trading will allow me to generate my primary source of income without being tied to a specific company or location, offering greater flexibility and financial freedom than can be obtained through my current corporate trajectory. 

**Trading Mission:**

Consistently improve trading strategy and discipline over time, while consistently generating profits that enable compounding growth of capital. 

Focus on constantly learning more about trading strategies, execution, and psychology to enable continuous improvement. I will always keep focus on the long-term vision and ensure every week brings me a step closer to reaching that ultimate vision.

**Timeline:**

* **Paper Trading**
   * **May 2021 – May 2021** – Develop initial framework for trading business plan. 
      * **Status: Complete.**
   * **May 2021 – Oct 2021** – Test out trading strategies and refine trading business plan based on what strategies work well for me in terms of generating consistent results. 
      * **Status: Complete – will focus on trading stocks with Relative Strength / Weakness vs. the market and in line with longer term trend (daily chart).**
   * **Oct 2021 – Feb 2022** – Execute refined trading business plan to prove concept prior to transitioning into live trading and make any final adjustments to trading plan prior to transition to live trading.
      * **Status: Complete.**
* **Live Trading**
   * **Feb 2022 – Feb 2023** – Begin live trading, at a minimum of 1x per week (target 2x per week), objective is to show the potential for modest returns but more importantly with minimal drawdowns in trading capital, confirming the consistency of the trading strategy.
      * **Status: In Progress.** 
   * **Feb 2023 – Feb 2025** – After 1 year of live trading, objective is to transition from modest returns to consistent returns that would be sufficient to provide full-time income if done daily.
* **Professional Trading**
   * **Feb 2025 – Onwards** – Refine trading business plan for transition into trading on a full-time basis and then transition into becoming a professional full-time day trader.

 **Objectives for Live Trading**

Starting account sized for live trading will be $30,000. The objective will be to build this account to $300,000 before transitioning to trading full time. Reaching this threshold will prove that the results from live trading have a clear, repeatable edge that has lasted over a long timeframe, while also providing sufficient starting capital to generate a full-time income.

**Daily & Weekly:**

There will not be a daily or weekly P&L goal given my trading frequency. On shorter timeframes, the focus will be on trading discipline and psychology. This means following the trading system, honoring risk limits (position sizes) and having the mental discipline to follow all aspects of my trading routine. Daily objectives for mindset management and mental discipline are outlined in the section on being my own trading coach. 

**Monthly:**

Every month at the end of the month I will hold a detailed review of my trading for the month. All trades for that month will be reviewed, and all trading statistics will also be reviewed. 

Here are the most important metrics and associated targets for each metric:

* Win percentage – target 75%, excluding all trades with P&L +/- $20 as scratches
* Profit factor – target 2.0
* P&L – target 5% monthly account value appreciation

Over time, these targets may be adjusted as my trading abilities improve. Eventually, my aspiration is to reach the following levels, which may not be achieved until I am trading full-time:

* Win percentage – target 85%, excluding all trades with P&L +/- $20 as scratches
* Profit factor – target 4.0
* P&L – target 10% monthly account value appreciation

With a $300,000 account base, this would translate to $360,000 yearly income, assuming profits are withdrawn monthly. The below chart shows the equity build of the account if the following return levels can be reached:

* 2022 – 5% per month return 
* 2023 – 6% per month return
* 2024 on onwards – 7% per month return 

This assumes that all taxes are paid for by other income to prevent the need to take equity from the account. This results in the account reaching $300,000 in early 2025 which is in line with the desired timing to go full-time. 

This trajectory will be updated based on actual trading results through the coming years. If I underperform this equity build, that means it will take longer to go full-time – I will not attempt to “make up for lost time” after a down month, as this will likely lead to poor trading behaviors. Similarly, if I overperform this equity build, that may allow me to go full-time in less time. If this occurs, I will take to take a decision whether to accelerate the process or keep on track for early 2025 full-time transition and then have a higher starting capital when I go full-time.

<img src="cache/images/16aeb706947ba50cf0c8af0f8cf8ec46.png" alt="Reddit Image">

Current trading account balance is $39,700 at the end of May 2022, this is used as the starting balance in the equity build curve above.

&#x200B;

#### Part II: Money Management & Trading Strategy

**Money and Risk Management Principles**

Risk management is **extremely important**. Avoiding account blow up is significantly more important than trying to get rich quick. The objective is to generate consistent results that will provide sufficient confidence in the trading program to eventually go full time.

**Initial starting capital is $30,000 for the live trading account. Sizing up in terms of position size will not be done until certain trading capital thresholds are met.**

The objective will be to keep risk per trade below a certain threshold. Position sizing will be based on the defined risk per trade and mental stop. For example, if the defined risk per trade is $1,000 and the mental stop for a trade is $2 below the entry, then the maximum position size for that trade would be 500 shares. As the trading account grows, the defined risk per trade will rise according to the table below. In general these levels correspond to 1% of the account size, sounded down.

It is not a requirement to trade up to this size, this is simply a maximum. For extremely high conviction trades, I will allow myself to go up to 2x the maximum position size, but there should be a maximum of one trade per day that is given the ability to size up in this manner.

  

<img src="cache/images/12fc57efbea54d4120382a9434ccab1a.png" alt="Reddit Image">

In addition to the position size limits, there will be a maximum loss of 3% of trading capital per day from trades opened that day. Once that level is reached, no new trades for the day should be opened and I will stop trading or transition to paper trading for the rest of the day. The below table can be used for sizing based on the current risk of $300 per trade, based on the price difference between the entry and the mental stop:

   

<img src="cache/images/9db644f4c6a7e813a55cbddb7814a46f.png" alt="Reddit Image">

**Trading Framework & Routine**

There will be no limit to the number of trades per day, but part of the post trading day activity will be to assess whether overtrading is occurring. This will not be defined by the number of trades taken, but rather by assessing whether the quality of the entry/setups taken degrades throughout the day (or is just poor in general). 

While it’s not a hard target, I would like to target makes 10-20 trades per day on average. In the early stages of my trading development, the target should be lower to allow for a high degree of focus when executing trades and ensuring that every single trading criteria is met – in the 5-10 trades per day range. 

If overtrading is observed, a maximum number of trades per day can be put in place for a short period to help drive focus on quality of setups, but this will not become a permanent rule.

Trading will not be focused on a specific timeframe. The intent will be to utilize the full trading day, with the following breakdown of time (all times CST):

* 6:30 AM – 7:00 AM – Wake Up, Shower, Coffee
* 7:00 AM – 8:30 AM – Pre-Market
   * Read the following daily posts to get a feeling for the market and any key overnight events that may be relevant for today:
      * “The Morning Brief” from Yahoo Finance
      * “The Market Wrap-up” from TradeXchange
      * “The Morning Mash-up” from TradeXchange
      * All new posts on the Walter Bloomberg discord and TradeXchange feed
   * Review overnight price action for SPY, QQQ, and all stock(s) with open positions
   * Review charts for any stocks on watchlist or those that came up during morning reading
   * Review Option Stalker scanner for stocks of interest, specifically:
      * Pre-Open Gainers / Losers
      * Gap-Up / Gap-Down
      * Pop-Bull and Pop-Bear
   * Read Pete’s pre-market comments on One Option
* 8:30 AM – 9:15 AM – The Open
   * Focus on watching the market and monitoring the behavior of individual stocks
   * Do not make any entries in the first 15 minutes
   * Do not focus on making entries – at maximum, enter 1-2 new trades during this time
   * Objectives:
      * Get a feel for market direction based on SPY price action, 1OP indicator, and chat room commentary to set stage for trading the rest of the day
      * Identify individual stocks with Relative Strength / Weakness to SPY
* 9:15 AM – 2:00 PM – Trading Session 
   * Make trades based on trading plan (see next section)
* 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM – The Close
   * Focus more on exiting trades then entering trades
   * Make decisions on what stocks will be held overnight, and close the rest
* 3:00 – 5:00 PM – After Hours
   * Review results from the day for each individual trade
   * Journal for the day – see the section of being my own trading coach for details

#### Part III: Trading Strategy

The focus of my trading strategy will be based on the following key principles:

* The majority of stocks (70-80%) will follow the market as measured by SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
   * This applies even if they are not in the S&P 500.
   * This only applies to stocks over $10.00 which will be the focus of this trading strategy.
* Focus will be on going long on stocks that have Relative Strength vs. SPY and going short stocks that have Relative Weakness vs. SPY.
* Monitoring the market is critical and will dictate trading. 
   * I will not go long on stocks when I have a short market bias
   * I will not short stocks when I have a long market bias.
   * I can go either long or short when I have a neutral market bias, but these trades only be the highest quality setups on the strongest/weakest stocks
* Market direction will be determined based on the following factors:
   * Medium/long term trend of the market on the daily chart
   * Price trend of the given day (current price vs. opening price)
   * 1OP cycles 
* All positions taken will be in line with the longer term trend for the stock (daily chart). By trading stocks in line with the prevailing daily trend (long stocks with bullish daily charts and short stocks with bearish daily charts), I will have more staying power in my position and can hold positions overnight as a swing trade when needed. 
* 90% of trades will be **Stock only.** Exceptions are covered in the Options and Futures section.

Relative strength and relative weakness will be defined as per the table below. Relative strength and relative weakness will also be measured via the 1OSI indicator on Option Stalker and the RealRelativeStrength indicator on thinkorswim.

<img src="cache/images/85c6241ea66e543073b50f60f8480ec1.png" alt="Reddit Image">

**Trade Criteria:**

To enter a trade, the following conditions must be met at a minimum.

<img src="cache/images/df7fc9df98276cad4a5085abe7a2c208.png" alt="Reddit Image">

In addition to the above minimum requirements, the following factors will make for a stronger trade in general. Most trades should have at least one of these factors met, ideally multiple. 

<img src="cache/images/6f69961bdbd128c891edf2be373a6ca8.png" alt="Reddit Image">

In the requirements, trade entry criteria are referenced. It is important that in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for a trade, the timing of the entry should be such that it is upon confirmation and not anticipatory in nature. This also helps in making entries at prices that will not immediately reverse after entering the position. Therefore, one of the following criteria must be met before entering the trade:

* Trendline breach:
   * Breach of a downward sloping trendline to the upside on the 5-minute chart for long positions 
   * Breach of an upward sloping trendline to the downside on the 5-minute chart for short positions.
* Compression break-out
   * Break out of a compression to the upside on the 5-minute chart for long positions 
   * Break out of a compression to the downside on the 5-minute chart for short positions
* 3/8 EMA cross:
   * 3-period EMA crossing above the 8-period EMA on the 5-minute chart, or coming back to and then separating above for long positions
   * 3-period EMA crossing below the 8-period EMA on the 5-minute chart, or coming back to and then separating below for short positions
* Market confirmation:
   * 1OP cross above after falling below 0 confirmed by technical price action on SPY indicating a bullish market move may be beginning
   * 1OP cross below after rising above 0 confirmed by technical price action on SPY indicating a bearish market move may be beginning

Before entering a trade, the following steps will be taken:

1. Confirm that all minimum requirements are met

2. Confirm which additional factors are met to gauge quality of the trade

3. Wait for trade entry criteria to be reached

4. Define price target

5. Define mental stop loss 

6. Define position size – calculate number of stocks to trade based on position size/risk criteria.

**Exits**

The following reasons for exiting a trade will be utilized. Whenever one of the below conditions are met, the trade must be exited:

1. Stop loss defined before entering the trade is hit – this will be handled via mental stops

2. Major technical violation on the daily chart such as breaking a major SMA or horizontal support/resistance level on a closing basis

3. Hit profit target – these will not always be defined when entering trades, but when they are they must be followed

4. Thesis no longer applies – if original thesis for entering trade no longer holds (lost Relative Strength or Weakness), 3/8 EMA crossed back against position (if used as entry criteria), etc.

5. Market direction changes against trade – only exception to this is if the position is being used as a hedge against other positions and the overall portfolio is aligned with the market direction change

6. Earnings overnight or the next morning – always sell before the close, do not hold any trades over earnings (except time spreads)

While not a required exit criterion, positions can also be exited if a time stop in my head is reached or if the stock stops moving as expected, even if it doesn’t firmly meet one of the above criteria.

#### Part V: Options Trading Strategies

Debit Spreads – Both Call Debit Spreads (CDS) & Put Debit Spreads (PDS)

* All entry criteria for long and short trades apply to spreads – only trade the absolute best setups
* Minimum of $2.50 spread (due to commissions impact on profitability of lower spread trades), but ideally $5.00 spreads
* Maximum debit of 50% of the spread
* Long call/put must at ATM, and ideally slightly ITM
* Trade current week expiry only
* Maximum total debit of $300, or: 
   * 2-3 contracts for $2.50 spreads
   * 1-2 contracts for $5.00 spreads
   * $10.00 spreads cannot be traded unless it is an A+ setup (see below), and spreads below $2.50 should not be traded due to commissions cost impact on returns
* In A+ setups, can trade up to $600 debit, but maximum of 2 positions this size at a given time and not in the same direction (e.g. CDS & PDS, not 2 CDSs or 2 PDSs)
* This enables $10.00 spreads to be added, 1 contract at a time
* Profit targets should be put in as soon as positions are entered – these targets can be more aggressive later in the week at time decay impacts the short strike position more and the spread narrows in on it’s intrinsic value):
   * Monday: 15-20% of debit
   * Tuesday: 25-30% of debit
   * Wednesday: 35-40% of debit
   * Thursday: 50-60% of debit
   * Friday: 60-90% of debit
* Positions will generally be held until profit target is hit or until expiration, thus assuming the full risk of the initial debit. Exceptions:
   * Key support/resistance level broken on the daily chart that goes against the trade and 10% or more of the spread value remains – exit for a loss in this case.
   * Friday CDS or PDS taken as day trades that I would otherwise exit the equivalent stock position and 10% or more of the spread value remains – exit for a loss in this case.

Options – Both Calls and Puts

* All entry criteria for long and short trades apply to spreads – only trade the absolute best setups
* Options price must be between $1.00 and $10.00
   * Lower limit is to prevent commissions cost from being a significant portion of the trade
   * Upper limit is to manage risk
* Maximum total debit per position of $1000 with a target average position of $500
* Trade expiry 2-3 weeks out (the expiry date the week after next)
* Profit targets will be defined by the expected move of the stock and should be written down when entered, if target is not at least 30% return on the debit it should not be entered
* Exits will be based on mental stops defined on the chart of the underlying stock

**Total positions across CDSs, PDSs, Calls and Puts should not exceed a total of $2,000 debit.** 

  

Time Spreads

* Objective is to profit on the IV crush that occurs after earnings by taking the following positions:
   * Short ATM call with current week expiry
   * Long ATM call with next week expiry
* Trade should only be done on stocks that generally don’t beat expectations using Option Stalker functionality to check
* Total risk is initial debit
* Objective will be to take profit on the time spread by buying back the short ATM call with current week expiry and selling the long ATM call with next week expiry for a credit higher than the initial debit
* Positions will be entered the day before earnings (after-hours reporting that day or pre-market reporting the next day following entry)
* Put profit target to sell in for 30% before open after earnings, and lower as needed to get a fill
* If not filled the day after earnings for the profit target or breakeven, either:
   * Close out position for a loss if the calls are ITM
   * Let the short call expire and let the long call run the next week
* Do not leg out of the trade, that increases the total risk of the position – this can be considered once I have made over 100 time spread trades but not until then
* Maximum debit per position of $300 – this can potentially be increased to $500 per position but only if that is the only spread being held overnight

#### Part VI: Futures Trading Strategies

/ES Contracts

* The only Futures contract that will be traded is /ES, the mini-contract on S&P 500 futures
* The maximum position size will be 1 /ES contract, with the only exception being if there is an open /ES trade that is up by 10 points, I can add a 2nd contract, but need to adjust the stop to the original entry point (or higher) such that the maximum loss remains 10 total points (5 points per contract)
* The maximum loss per trade will be 10 points, which is $500
* This will be the only trade where hard stops are used – this is done to manage risk given that I do not have significant experience trading futures contracts. Over time, this requirement may be re-assessed
* There will be very strict criteria for trading /ES:
   * Trades must be in direction of the trend for the day (determined based on current price vs. open)
   * Trades must have a supporting 1OP bullish/bearish cross with price confirmation to be entered

Other Futures Contracts

* At this time, no other futures contracts will be traded
* Micro-contracts will not be traded due to high commission costs
* Over time, more contracts such as /NQ, /RTY will be added

#### Part VII: Trader Coaching Practices

In order to be a successful trader, having the right mindset, discipline, and ability to manage emotions will be critical to my long-term success. This section goes over the systems I will have in place in order to be successful in these critical areas.

Daily Practices

Below are the 12 key daily practices I have in place to manage mindset and mental discipline:

1. Complete full pre-market routine

* As part of the pre-market routine, do a set of pull-ups and a set of push-ups to near failure to help sharpen my mind through physical activity
* In addition to the steps outlined in the daily plan section, ask myself “What would make my trading a success today, even if I don’t make money?” and record the answer and play it back during at least one of the mindset check-ins

2. Do not open any new trades in the first 15 minutes of trading

3. Complete the full screening checklist for every trade entered

4. Define mental stop before entry on every trade

5. Record my trade entries with audio outlining my reason for the trade and how I plan to manage it 

6. Honor position sizing rules based on mental stops

7. Do not average down any losing positions

8. Do not look at P&L (of a trade, or daily P&L) – if this is violated, I will slap myself in the face (yes, really) and then take a short break and perform a mindset check-in

9. Honor all mental stops

10. Perform mindset check-ins throughout the day at 10:00 AM, 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM

* Watch out for frustration and overconfidence mental states
* As part of the mindset check-in, do some physical activity (pull-ups, push-ups, etc.)
* Before returning to trading, take 10 deep breathes to reset mental state and focus
* When returning to trading, focus first on the market, second on open positions, and third on new trading ideas

11. Run or perform other physical exercise at the end of the trading day to clear head

12. Perform daily journaling

* See section below on journaling practices
* § As part of the daily journal, I will give myself a grade on each of the above areas – A, B, C, D or F, the overall day can also be graded by totaling the grades (5 points for an A, 4 for a B, etc.)
* Identify any key lessons learned, insights, or document any key comments made by other traders worth saving for future reference

Trade Journal Practices

* Document the grades in the areas of mental discipline and share any thoughts on what went particularly well or poor on that day related to mental discipline or my mindset and thoughts during the trading day
* Include reflections on how I did on the top two areas of improvement and the top two strengths that I am focusing on in the current month
* Review each trade for the day and document reflections on:
   * Stock and trade selection – tag the setups that led to the entry
   * Market analysis
   * Trade management – tag any mistakes made
   * Mental discipline and mindset – including any negative thoughts or lines of thinking that may have impacted that trade (hope, loss avoidance, regret, self-blame)
* If I broke any rules during the day, document them using “The Daily Trading Coach” psychological journal format
* Situation in markets
* My thoughts, feelings and actions in response to the situation
* Consequences of these actions
* If I have a day where I reach my 3% maximum loss, I will write myself a detailed memo that explains what went wrong, why it went wrong, and what I will do to avoid making similar mistakes going forward and share it with the sub-group of the RDT sub-reddit

Monthly Trading Performance Review

* § This should be done on the first weekend following the completion of the month. For this to be successful, at least 4-6 hours should be set aside for the review.
* Review key statistics for the month:
   * Win percentage – target 75%, excluding all trades with P&L +/- $20 as scratches
   * Profit factor – target 2.0
* P&L – target 5% monthly account value appreciation
* I will share these statistics with the sub-group of the RDT sub-reddit as well as any major mindset challenges or victories as part of my monthly review
* Go through all of the trades made for the month, and review the trade again as well as the previous notes taken on it – conduct the Walkaway analysis for all stock trades made that month
* Assess how I am doing qualitatively in the following areas (give a grade of A, B, C, D or F):
   * Stock and trade selection
   * Market analysis
   * Overtrading
   * Trade management
   * Mental discipline, in particular identify where any of the following patterns are occurring often:
      * Placing impulsive, frustrated trades after losing ones
      * Becoming risk-averse and failing to take good trades after a losing period
      * Becoming overconfident during a winning period
      * Becoming anxious about performance and cutting winning trades short
      * Oversizing trade to make up for prior losses
      * Working on trading when I’m losing money, but not when I’m making money
      * Becoming caught up in the moment to moment of the market rather than actively managing a trade, preparing for your next trade, or managing your portfolio
      * Beating myself up after losing trades and losing your motivation for trading
      * Trading for excitement and activity rather than to make money
      * Taking trades because I’m afraid of missing a market move

   * Ensure that there is a balance or positive skew to my coaching language in the journal to make sure I have a positive coach-trader relationship with myself – if I am always negative, I will shy away from the practices like journaling needed to make myself successful
* Ensure that my entries include my emotions during the day and aren’t just focused on trading execution – I need to leverage my entries to motivate change
* Identify the top two areas of improvement and the top two strengths of the past month to build on for the next month of trading
* On the areas of improvement, spend 5 minutes on each doing visualization exercises where I visualize myself in trading situations and exhibit the desired behaviors
* On the strengths, review example trades where I have exhibited this strength to reinforce with myself that this is in fact an area of strength for me
* Assess how well I am doing at self-coaching – am I spending enough time on coaching efforts? Do I have clear goals each day? Am I working on my trading skills enough?

* I have personal issues from my past that can manifest themselves and negatively impact my trading. The themes behind these issues are related to...
* Removed the rest of this section, but this includes the themes behind issues that have translated negatively into my trading, how they manifest themselves, and what I am doing to monitor them (most of which is outlined in the above section)
