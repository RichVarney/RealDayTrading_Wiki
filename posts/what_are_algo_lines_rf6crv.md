Algo lines are basically trend lines that are drawn by algos to identify support and resistance.  They connect top of  a candle that doesnt have any candles around it at the same level (so it indicates a recent high)  to tops of other candles without going through any candles (there is an exception which i will cover) The more candle tops that are touched by the algo line and the longer the line the stronger the resistance  is (using bottoms of candles would create a support line.)  The candle that initiates the beginning of the algo line should not have massive volume such as a candle produced by earnings or news.

Algo lines can be either ascending or descending. The strongest resistance would be descending algo line, where an ascending algo line is resistance but much less so since the price can follow the algo line up without breaking it and still be at a higher price.

On the other hand ascending support lines are the strongest support while descending support lines are not as important for the same reason as ascending resistance lines .

The exception to an algo line  not cutting through wicks or tails is based on volume. If the volume on the candle that has a wick or tail that the algo line would cut through, cutting through the wick or tail is ok if the volume is very high but if the volume is low or close to average the top of the wick or bottom of the tail should be used and the wick or tail should not be cut through.

So you can see algo lines are simply trend lines with some specific rules that the algos follow when drawing these lines. They can be very strong support and resistance and should be considered when entering a trade or deciding whether to exit a trade

I have had several traders ask me about these and i hope this clears up those questions.
