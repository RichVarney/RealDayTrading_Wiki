Thanks to [anonymousrussb](https://www.reddit.com/user/anonymousrussb/) and [Gora\_Brownie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gora_Brownie/)'s amazing work putting together the Walk-Away Analysis Template which can be found here: 

([https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/ujbd7w/walkaway\_analysis\_partial\_automated\_template/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/ujbd7w/walkaway_analysis_partial_automated_template/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

I did the analysis for my trades Thursday and Friday (the most recent two days when I focused solely on my regular account).  I am only counting my stock trades (I had three Option trades, but they were all Lottos).  It also works out well that Thursday was a bear trend day and Friday was bullish - however, both days were extremely volatile. 

This is the type of analysis you should do for all your trades.  Depending on how many trades you average per day you can either do this once a week or once a month (if you only average 2-3 trades a day it may be best to do it at the end of each month) - either way you want at least 25 trades.

You also will want to compare the results to the previous times to see which areas are improving and which have declined.  

My results are these for the 25 trades are:

**Wins: 22 - Losses: 2 - Break-Even: 1**

**Overall Win-Rate: 92%**

**Profit Factor: 2.40**

If I waited on average 5-Minutes before closing each position:

**5-Min Later: Wins: 17 - Losses: 8**

**5-Min Later: Win-Rate: 68%**

**5-Min Later:** **Profit Factor: 2.32**

If I waited on average 1-Hour before closing each position:

**1-Hour Later: Wins: 15 - Losses: 10**

**1-Hour Later Win-Rate: 60%**

**1-Hour Later Profit Factor: 2.60**

If I waited until the end of the day before closing each position:

**EOD: Wins: 12 - Losses: 13** 

**EOD Win-Rate: 48%**

**EOD Profit Factor: 1.49**

If I waited until the end of the next day before closing each position:

**End of Next Day: Wins: 11 - Losses: 14**

**End of Next Day Win-Rate: 44%**

**End of Next Day Profit Factor: 2.20**

While it appears I would have made a bit more money if I waited for an hour longer to exit the trades, that statistic is somewhat skewed due to two trades in particular - **UPST** and **AFRM,** both of which jumped up significantly after I exited.  Those two stocks also skew the **End of Day** and **End of Next Day** averages to such an extent that without them the statistics during these time-frames would be *much* worse.

Overall I am happy with my exits on these trades, particularly in a market that was very much momentum based.

My Profit Factor overall is a bit low, but this analysis is telling me that I am exiting at the right time, especially considering the skew that **UPST** and **AFRM** are causing to the numbers.  

On average I held on to winners for **30 minutes** and the 2 losing trades were held on average for **90 Minutes**, the most profitable hold time was between **6 and 10 minutes.**

The two times of day I was most profitable during this period was between **7am to 8am (pst)** and **9am to 10am (pst)**

The best set-up was:

**Relative Strength/Relative Weakness - In the same direction as Market - Momentum - Good Relative Volume**

This set-up matches up with the shorter hold times for the winning trades.

Looking at the two losers I had **MU** and **AMD,** both were exacerbated by extended hold times and both would have, ironically, been also improved by holding on longer.  Essentially, I held both of these positions for exactly the wrong length of time, I either should have cut them sooner or continued holding them as each recovered after I exited.  My exits on these two were due to a distrust in the current market given its tendency to be prone towards violent shifts in direction.

When we do the **$50K - Trade for a Living Challenge**, I will do this type of analysis at the end of each week.

I hope this helps as a template for some!

Best, H.S.
