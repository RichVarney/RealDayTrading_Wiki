Think or Swim isn't known for having a decent scanner.  Its clunky, and you have to be very specific on how to 'ask' for conditions. Otherwise you have to sift for the treasure in the pile of results. If you haven't explored the think script condition wizard, you are seriously missing out.  It can take pretty much any study, allow you to specifically scan for a result, and have it valid within a set amount of bars looking back.  While its not TC2000 flex scan neat..... it is a far more powerful way to get decent results. Simply plugging in a value will show that it had occurred within the timeframe period selected.  My 1 day charts, for example, look back 3 years.  It will show all results if it occurred within that period. The 'within a set amount of bars' makes a ton of difference.

To start off with, I use u/workpiece indicator that was built here on the sub for an RS/RW indicator ([https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rpi75s/real\_relative\_strength\_indicator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rpi75s/real_relative_strength_indicator/))  Its the one I am used to.  I have this indicator saved as 'HSeldonRealRelativeStrength' in my system because it was one of many that I was attempting to use.  This is the one I stuck with.  I am going to provide 3 links.  First one is sharing the above indicator.  Save the first one exactly as typed if you intend to use the RRS/RRW scanners right below it.  They will not work otherwise. If you need help importing via a link, look at the Custom Columns instructions link, step 2.

HSeldonRealRelativeStrength - [http://tos.mx/Icgyp5R](http://tos.mx/Icgyp5R) \- again, save this exactly as labeled

RRS Scanner - [http://tos.mx/fZUCXcg](http://tos.mx/fZUCXcg)

RRS Scanner with ATR - [http://tos.mx/FrQosVa](http://tos.mx/FrQosVa)  RRS with ATR 3 period - [http://tos.mx/h2yqdft](http://tos.mx/h2yqdft)

RRW Scanner - [http://tos.mx/oPbTsuY](http://tos.mx/oPbTsuY)  RRW with ATR 3 period - [http://tos.mx/KBD61MT](http://tos.mx/KBD61MT)

RRW Scanner with ATR - [http://tos.mx/j8L1rr1](http://tos.mx/j8L1rr1)

These scans typically give 30-40 results.  I open a watchlist on the left side and sort by Relative strength in the columns to have fairly updated info at a glance.  If you find you aren't seeing A-Z, it might be time to adjust timeframes so fewer results show up.  Once you scan to your liking, resave and overwrite it.  This will force the watchlist to refresh and show the new results.  Do not be afraid to use the pencil and adjust the lookback period or anything else.  These will get you close, but don't be afraid to tinker with it.  The RRS scanner has a lookback of 3 periods for example.  The RRS with ATR has a lookback of 2.  Most times 3 bars is great. Experiment with it.

As you can see this scanner is fairly simple.  I have 4 timeframes.  The top one is set to .5 strength. If I need fewer results, I choose the daily timeframe.  The scan will give results that have a daily trend of .5 and a 15m trend for the last two bars of 2 or higher.  The more timeframes you have different, the stronger the trend.

This is what my watchlist looks like.  I click on the columns to sort.  You can see I have 3 time frames at a glance, relative volume and ATR.  The sort shows I have at least gotten to the 'V' stocks.  I am getting enough results without having all 50 watchlist spots taken by the time letter 'F' comes along.

I provide the links below so you don't need to.  Its handy info to have though.

These are the column headers as shown above.  You can install them by following the directions in the link below.

I have two more that scan relative strength, that are not as rigid as the above.

1D5M Relative strength - [http://tos.mx/IqSEIf9](http://tos.mx/IqSEIf9)

1D5M Relative weak - [http://tos.mx/etfyrjS](http://tos.mx/etfyrjS)

Hope these are of help.  Any questions, just ask.

UPDATE #1:  I forgot that paper accounts cannot utilize studies.  When I am working out of my paper account I open a separate instance of Think or Swim.  Simply right-click on the icon on the taskbar and select think or swim.  It should allow you to log into think or swim again.  Log in to the appropriate instance and you now have the ability to use the cash side for the cool stuff, and the paper account order page to get into and out of trades.  This also will not work if you do not have live data.  I overlap the order screens so I can simply click and have the screen in the background come forward so I can work off it.  Pictures below.

Hope this clears things up.

Update #2:  I had my Dev versions mixed up when I took screen shots of the dev with ATR in the scan.  I have included the version with ATR up above with the previous version.  I also at some point moved my 30M column to 15M and have updated that link (and sent out an update notification to those of you that already downloaded it)

Let me know if you find any more of my mistakes!!!  Thanks for the patience.
