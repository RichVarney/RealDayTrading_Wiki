If you have not used Heiken-Ashi candles in you technical analysis you may want to try using them to improve your trading. 

Heinen-Ashi candles (means average bar in Japanese) smooth out price action so identifying trends and reversals is clearer since they eliminate a lot of noise and make it easier to see trends and stay in a trade throughout the trend allowing for improved profits. 

Bullish HA candles have flat bottoms and bearish HA candles have flat tops. Bullish trends will have flat bottomed HA one after another  and bearish trends will have flat topped HA candles one after the other. Generally you can stay with a bullish trend as  long as no flat topped HA candles appear indicating a lull or reversal in the trend. (visa versa for bearish trends) .

Reversal in a bullish trend will have flat bottomed HA candles followed by smaller doji HA candles (having both wicks and tails) followed by flat topped bearish HA candle or candles. The doji candles indicate momentum is slowing and time to be prepared to take profit when a bearish HA candle appears. If the trend that is ending had many long bullish HA candles the reversal will require long bearish HA candles (more than 1) confirm the reversal otherwise it may just be a small pullback in the bullish trend which may continue.  

One thing to be aware of is the price of a stock on the HA chart wont reflect the actual current price because of the way HA candles are calculated so be sure to refer to your normal candlestick chart for the current price.

There are other nuances to using HA candles in trading but try looking at some charts using HA candles and i think you will find them very helpful in your trading helping to identify trends and trend reversals.
