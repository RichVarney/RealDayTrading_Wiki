I record a video at the end of each year and it's time for this year's prediction. As short term-traders we really do not need to look beyond the next two months, but it is critical for us to get that right. I am bearish and I explain why in the video. 

I included a link to last year's market forecast so that you can see if I'm full of crap. It has good technical analysis and it is a worthy watch. 

In today's video I described each of the bear markets since Y2K so that you will know the price action to watch for next year. It is a long video so grab some popcorn.

Congratulations, you made it through a very tough year! The lessons you've learned this year will last a lifetime.

**Happy New Year!**
