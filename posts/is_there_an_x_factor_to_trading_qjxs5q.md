This is topic is rarely discussed.  We are all taught the same things, and yet we also all know that you can teach 100 people the exact same method and you will get varying degrees of success.

Most of that is due to the amount of time, effort and focus one puts into implementing those methods.  Much like school or anything else, the people that put in the work will outperform those that do not.

However, in life, we also know that there are some people that just *seem* to be better at some things, and no matter how hard you try, you can't reach their level of success.

In Academia the answer to this is somewhat more clear - some people are just smarter than others.  Someone with a higher level of intelligence that puts in the same effort as someone with less intelligence is going to do better.

We see it most clearly in Sports - no matter how much one practices and tries, they can't beat out someone else that has natural talent.

Although it has been said and seen many times that *Hard Work + Less Talent will out-perform Laziness  + More Talent almost every time*.  *I say almost because there are some examples of people that just have an extraordinary amount of innate ability (e.g. nobody is going to beat Michael Jordan in his prime no matter how much they practice!).*

So what about with trading?  Personally, I have witnessed some traders that just *seem to know* when to enter and when to exit, and do better than someone else with an equal level of knowledge in reading the charts.  Is that *talent*?  Do some traders just have a better *innate* ability to read the charts, a better *intuition* for the market?

I think it is more complicated than that.  In trading you are taking various factors into account at once - you might see volume slowing down in a stock, the market pulling back a bit, other stocks in the same sector as the one you are looking at starting to fall.  Trendline get breached, price-action changes, and for every one of these things the trader needs to assign a "weight" in their mind.  Each variable is not *equal*, some are more meaningful than others.  Great traders are able to assign the correct *weights* in their minds and come to a decision faster, and more accurately than other traders.

What causes this ability to correctly assign those weights?  I have found that a combination of *experience*, *intelligence*, *mindset*, and *knowledge* is what allows for this difference in ability.  And what one lacks in one area they need to make up for in another.  Perhaps you do not have the *experience* or even *intelligence* that another trader might have - but you spend all your time studying the markets and methods.  You dedicate yourself to working on your *mindset*. In doing so, you can compensate for those deficiencies and become more successful than your more *experienced* and/or *more intelligent* counterpart.

In the end, my conclusion is that while yes, there is an ***"X"*** factor - it is not akin to natural innate ability in a sport, but rather a mix of attributes that you, as a trader, can work on to overcome and obtain the same level of competency.

So once again, trading successfully for a living - is something everyone can do if they work hard enough on reaching the goal.

Curious to hear your thoughts!
