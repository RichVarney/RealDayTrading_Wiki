Yesterday I recorded a video on how to leg out of a bullish put spread that went bad and today I recorded the follow-up. These are tricky maneuvers and consequently, novices should exit the spread as a spread. Originally this trade was based on bullish price action in the stock, relative strength, technical support and a strong market. The thesis was that we might see a market pullback in the next week or two, but that the stock should be able to maintain support. The spread was sold below technical support, it was well out of the money and it was a neutral to slightly bullish position. The goal was to take advantage of time decay as the holiday was approaching and it was in a video a couple of weeks ago.

The character of the market changed Friday after Powell's statement in Jackson Hole. We saw heavy selling and that was a warning sign. The stock (LOW) broke the technical support level I was leaning on and I needed to exit the trade.

Keep in mind that when these swing trades go bad, I am still day trading. The gains from shorts last Friday more than offset the loss on the spread. Friday was the day to leg out of the spread because we could identify the selling pressure early in the day and that momentum was likely to continue. There was another chance to leg out this morning and I described it in the video.

The difficulty with legging out of bullish put spreads is that you originally had a neutral to slightly bullish position with limited risk. To a large degree, it was a non-directional trade. When we buy back the short put, we have a trade that is outright bearish and it is a directional trade. That means I need immediate follow through now!

***Your opinion of the market and/or the stock must have changed substantially to justify legging out.*** It is critically important that you wait for a bearish market set-up and you need to make sure the stock is weak relative to the market.

In the video I recorded today I recapped the process of legging out and I reviewed the trade. I also provided market analysis and how we knew that a gap reversal this morning was likely.
