To start off with - remember the ultimate goal here:

***To be consistently profitable each month in a manner that allows you to pay yourself a sustainable salary***

Your job as a *Day Trader* needs to be just as dependable as any other employment.  That means at the end of every month the salary you pay yourself should be a predictable number with very little variation around it.

If your lifestyle and account size has you making $120,000 a year, you can't lose $10,000 one month and make $30,000 the next month to equal out to $20,000 in two months.  You need to consistently make $10,000 a month, give or take a few hundred dollars.  Why?  Because you have bills to pay, food to eat, a life to live, and if you start having negative months that will eat into your savings and create debt.  Not what you want.

I take out profits at the end of each month and leave the base - starting the next month with the same base as the previous one.  Every six months I increase the base by 15% (32.5% a year), which in turn increases the expected monthly profit (a compromise between compounding the money, which doesn't allow for any salary to live off of and not increasing the base at all which doesn't allow for you to essentially give yourself "raise")

So how can you do this?   ***A High Win Rate.*** 

Let's take two examples using the goal of making $9,900 per month (*easier math to write out)*.

**Person 1:**

**Win Rate: 80%**

**Profit Ratio: 1.5 to 1**

**Number of Trades Per Day: 15**

***On average there are 22 trading days a month - so this would equal 330 trades a month.***

***You are winning 264 (80%) and losing 66 (20%)***

*In order to make $9,900 a month, you would need to average $45 a win and $30 a loss (1.5 to 1 ratio).*

**With this win rate you can be 95% confident that your average trade will produce between $26.77 and $33.23, and your average day will be between $401.55 and $498.45**

Also notice that because your win rate is so high, you are only risking $30 per trade.  

Because your expected Profit ratio is low, these trades are not difficult to find (i.e. 100 shares of **AMD** going up .30 or 1,000 shares of **AMD** going up .03).

That is literally all you need to do to make $118,800 a year with a win rate of 80%.  Plus, there is not much variation around this average, so you are not going to be dealing with huge swings in income every month.

But now let's look at **Person 2:**

**Win Rate: 40%**

**Profit Ratio: 3:1** 

**Number of Trades Per Day: 5**

*Why only 5 trades a day?* Because finding setups that give you a 3 to 1 potential return are rare, somedays you might go the entire day without one.  There is no version that know of that allows for a average profit ratio of 3 to 1, and doing much more than 5 trades per day.

*Why a 3 to 1 Profit Ratio?* Because if you are accepting a 40% win rate, your level of profit on your wins needs to be significantly higher than your average loss.

**That is an average of 110 trades per month - of which you are losing 66 trades (on average) and winning 44 of them.**  

On average you need to make roughly $90 a trade, which, sticking to your profit ratio means that your wins need to average to roughly $450 and your losses average at $150 (*remember it is 40% win rate, so for every ten times, you are making $450 four times for $1,800 and losing $150 six time for $900, which equals $900 for every ten trades, or $90 per trade)*.  

However, remember we talked about consistency?  The standard error for this model is $28.02 for the $90 mean at 68% confidence.

So what do that mean?

**95% of the time your daily take will be between $175 and $725.**

Compare that range to **Person 1**.  Also realize that on roughly 8% of the days, you will lose all five trades, which is a loss of -$750 for that day.

\------

The advantage **Person 1** has is clear - easier setups, less risk, and more consistent returns.

Yes, of course you could have a 5% win rate and be profitable, but that is closer to playing lottery than it is treating this like a job.

Win rate is the number one thing one needs to work on as you start their journey in Day Trading.  It not only assures that you have the best strategy, which works and is repeatable, but there is an intangible mental benefit as well:

*When you are winning at least 8 out of every 10 trades it has a huge positive impact on your psyche.   Whereas a strategy that returns a 40% win rate is not only more difficult to execute consistently, you are also losing six out of every ten trades.*

I use the strategy of Relative Strength/Weakness, combined with an equitable market direction, in a stock with a strong daily chart, one that typically exceeds the 80% bar - whereas as momentum strategy (while fun as hell) typically fall below 60%.

Last week I detailed out every trade I did, as I did them, live on this forum, and my total win rate was over 83%.  Next week I plan to start the $30K challenge, with full transparency, where you can follow along with the trades, the posted results, and whatever TraderSync stats you want me to run.

Have a great weekend!
