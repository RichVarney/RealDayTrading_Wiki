This is in response to the somber comments I'm seeing traders posting. I am not going to "pump sunshine up your ass". For many of you, the day of easy trading profits will never come. Paul Tutor Jones himself could stand over you and tell you what to buy and when to sell it and you would still figure out a way to fuck it up. Most of the traders in that camp have already been washed out and [I warned you of this a year ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/s8v4uz/the_unfortunate_truth_i_hope_you_never_experience/) This article is for the traders who have rolled up their sleeves and who have spent every waking hour studying and learning and who are hanging on by a thread.

The easy answer to the title is, when the 50-day moving average crosses the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500. That is a "golden cross" and it will only happen when market support has been established. Is this some kind of magic formula? No, bull markets are easier to trade than bear markets for many reasons.

Why are bull markets easier to trade? There is less volatility and the price action is much more orderly (predictable). In a bear market the price action is largely news driven. There are giant drops and violent bounces. We are always at the mercy of the Fed or an economic release. One little word change in the FOMC statement can produce wild swings. When the market is trending higher, the mood is more encouraging. People have jobs, the economy is doing better and 401(k)s are on the rise. In general, people are less inclined to short and they are less inclined to play the "Don't Pass" line in craps.

If the market takes the stairs higher and the elevator down, that means it spends much more time grinding higher than it does dropping. If you are long and you enter poorly, you can ride the trade out if the market is in a normal uptrend and eventually you will recover your losses. Bull markets mask poor trading habits and they are much more forgiving. In the chart below, you can see that it is much more dangerous to be short than long. When you're short and the market/stock lifts off, there is always the risk that this rally is the "real deal" and that you had better take your losses. The game is always tilted towards the bullish side and I have seen the Fed ease (unannounced) before the open on expiration Friday to screw as many shorts as possible (2008).

Right now some of you are thinking, “Thank you so much Pete, I will just wait for that golden cross.” Tom Brady did not become the GOAT by showing up a few minutes before game time. The countless hours of work and preparation made it possible for him to perform at the highest level on Sunday.

The lessons you have learned this last year will last a lifetime.

**1.** You have complete respect for the market and you realize you don’t know shit. Instead of trying to predict what the market is going to do, you trade what is in front of you.

**2.** You have learned to trade both sides of the market and that will help you to identify longer term trend reversals. This helped me make a killing in 2008 and 2022. That skill will also help you to exit trades because you are always aware of the warning signs when a trend is starting to weaken.

**3**. You learned to trade under volatile conditions where moves come out of nowhere. That experience has taught you to adapt to changing market conditions.

**4.** You’ve had to persevere losing days/weeks/months where there is little to no progress. That demonstrates that you love trading and that you have the mental toughness needed to be successful.

**5.** You’ve learned to cut your losses even when they have been devastating and you have clawed your way back. Taking losses is a cleansing process where you learn a lot about yourself.

Your time will come in 2023 and all of your training will pay off. There are record levels of cash sitting on the sidelines. When Asset Managers are satisfied that the Fed is done tightening, that a credit crisis has been averted and that economic activity is poised to rebound, you are going to see a massive market rally that lasts for many years. That time is **NOT** now. The market still has some work to do on the downside and the technicals are telling me this.

I know your pain because I have gone through it. I have traded since 1989, but in 2002 I left my corner office to trade full-time. By March of 2003, I was on the ropes. Those market conditions were similar to what we are seeing now.

You've made it through the toughest of markets and many of you are on the brink of busting this wide open. I see it in my chat room and I know who you are. To your surprise, you won't have to change much. Your picks are solid and you've learned the system.

I am often approached by enthusiastic traders and I ask them when they started trading. If there has not been a bear market since their start date, this thought clicks in my brain - "they might not make it". Until you've survived a bear market, I can't tell if you are going to be a good trader. In a few years, many of you will wear 2022 like a badge of honor.

Keep your spirits up, stay very disciplined for another six months and know that better trading conditions are just around the corner.
