I built a free stock scanner that helps you find stocks with relative strength/weakness, high relative volume and institutional involvement. It has live scans throughout the day (delayed just enough to satisfy the data overlords) and includes a number of scans that I think you'll find useful. I use this every day when trading and it serves up most of the good trades.

*\*\* 12/3 edit - I pushed a new version that should perform much better with high Reddit traffic. Enjoy!\*\**

I've built a lot of nice little features that will help you find stocks to trade:

* Pre-built scanners for long and short tickers - high relative volume, near high of the day, bull flag, and a bunch of others. I'll add more as new ideas come in
* Click on a ticker to view a 5-minute and daily chart
* Use the arrow keys to quickly move up/down. The tickers you recently reviewed are grayed out.
* Flag tickers green, red, or yellow
* New tickers are delivered throughout the trading day

It includes a number of really special scans like "[most active](https://www.zenscans.com/Most%20Active)", "[recent big candles](https://www.zenscans.com/Big%20Candles)", "[in the gap](https://www.zenscans.com/In%20Gap)".

Check it out: [www.zenscans.com](https://www.zenscans.com/).

It's free for you to use - maybe I'll build some subscription stuff later, but right now I'm paying for the data, hosting, and all my programming time. The underlying technology has been a labor of love for about two years, and the idea to create a scanner from my project has just recently come together.

Hope it helps!
