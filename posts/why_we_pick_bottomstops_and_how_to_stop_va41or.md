**Perception is a funny thing.**

Our decisions in life are, in large part, based not on how things actually are, but on how we perceive them to be.

One of the most common "perception" issues that most of you will be intimately familiar, is aptly called, *"The Grass is Always Greener"*.  Just as those with an average salary, house, car, etc. look with envy upon someone in a 6,000 sq ft home that drives an Aston Martin, the mirror image exist on the opposite side.  The struggling parents, working 2-3 jobs to just pay rent on a cramped apartment wishes they had that average salary, house, car, etc.

Again, it is all a matter of perception.

Let's tie that in to how we view stocks -

**There are four ways one can view the price of a stock:**

**1) Fair Value -** Based on the fundamentals of the company, a stock has a "fair value", which essentially is a calculation of "What is this company *actually worth today?"*  If you opened *Traders* *Lemonade Stand* and put $100 into it to buy the ingredients you need, but haven't even opened for business yet - that company is worth - $100.  If you issued 10 shares out to friends, those shares would be worth, at *fair value* $10 a share.

**2) Future Value -** Now of course, let's say you have a history of opening successful Lemonade Stands around the country, and the last three (each also started with only $100) all wound up selling for $100,000 after 2 years.  That is a 100X return on the initial investment.  Now if you offer out those 10 shares, but instead to just friends you open it up to 100 people, they'll start bidding on it. Based on the successful history there will be a strong prospect of future growth.  Considering the valuations on the previous companies, they might bid up the price of that stock to over $100+ a share, before the business even opens.  That price is based on \*Future Value (\*many Tech stocks are inflated from their "fair value" due to this idea).

***Thus, if the stock of that Lemonade Stand was worth $50 - someone with the perspective of "Fair Value" would think it is way over-priced, but someone that looks at it from the view of "Future Value" might consider the current price underpriced.***

**3) Past Value -** This is how most traders look at the current price - through the lens of *Past Value.*  It is undoubtedly the worst point-of-view one can take, but it is also the most *natural*.  We look at stocks like **ADBE**, or **MSFT** or just about any stock that isn't in the *Energy* sector and think of them as being ***down.***  They are ***"on sale"***.  That perception is based on their past pricing.  **ADBE** is currently at $394, but we can remember when it was over $650 not to long ago.  Our perception of the stock is that it is at a *low point* and thus likely to bounce back up.  This is where the notion of "picking a bottom" comes from - because surely a stock that used to be ***that*** strong cannot continue to drop.  We think, "Eventually it will get so cheap investors will pile in and drive it up again".   ***The issue with looking at price based on "Past Value" is the immediacy you expect the price to revert.***

**4) Current Value -** This final point-of-view is the one most rarely taken, but may in fact be the stance that prevents one from predicting *bottoms* or *tops*. This perspective is simple - the price of the stock is what it currently is, no more and no less.  Using **ADBE** as the example, the stock is worth $394 because that is what people are willing to pay for it right now.  It doesn't matter that it was worth $700 a few months ago, or below $200 back in 2018 - because right now people aren't willing to buy it for more than $394.  In this sense there is no "bottom" or "top" - **ADBE** can just as easily continue to drop as it could to start going back up.

***Now if one looks at ADBE through each of the four perspectives you would get the following:***

***Fair Value -*** *The fair value is roughly $205 - so from that perspective the stock is still way over-priced at $394.*  ***Over time, could be years, you expect the stock to eventually drop.***

***Future Value -*** *The projected value is between $550 and $615, and from that point-of-view it is currently under-priced.* ***Over time, could be years, you expect the stock to eventually go up.***

***Past Value -*** *The recent highs close to $700 means the stock is currently "on sale" and should bounce back up.*  ***In a short period of time, you expect the price to bounce back up.***

***Current Value -*** *You are looking only at the current price action to determine where the stock will go.* ***You have no expectation of the stock going up or down, other than that which the price-action shows you.***

Obviously we all know that at some point the market will resume going back up again, we don't know when that will occur, but we can say with almost certainty that it will.  And when that happens we also know that many of these stocks will head back up with it, but again we don't know when that will happen.

If we base our trading on any of the first three perspectives we will most likely get burned by trying to time the market.  Because then we aren't trading an asset based on the value we see in front of us, but rather on some value in our heads that we *think* it should be, but isn't.

For long-term investing it is fine to base your decisions off your *projected* value, as your portfolio can withstand the ebbs and flows that will occur before the market resumes its' upward climb.  So you would just buy shares of **ADBE** , and in a few years, if you're right, you could double your investment.

But in trading you aren't waiting a few years, or even a few weeks - you are looking at the next few hours or days.  And given that time frame, it is unreasonable to use anything other than the price of the stock within that same time-frame.  It doesn't matter that **ADBE** was worth $699 back in November if you are trading it right now, all that matter is that it is currently worth $394.  When you think about it that way, there is no **bottom** or **top** \- there is only the current price.

Think of those people that bought *Calls* on **SPY** going into the weekend because "it has to bounce back up".  **Why?**  The last price people were willing to pay for the *ETF* was $389.83 - come Monday that price may seem *expensive, thus causing a drop* or *cheap*, *thus causing a rise*.

*Technical Analysis* can help us decipher the price action and anticipate the levels where those perceptions might change - but it ***cannot predict a bottom or a top***.  When you are doing that, it is ***you and you alone that are predicting, based on nothing more than a "feeling".***

Now look at your account, look at your past performance, and ask yourself -  ***how much do you trust your "feeling" to be right? How often has it been right in the past?***

So the trick is simple - ***The price of the stock is what the price of the stock is - no more, no less - that is what the stock is worth.  It isn't "under or over-priced". That is how you need to think of it.***

Yes you need to look at the daily chart and look at the recent trend, but you are *trading* *what is in front of you*.

There are hundreds of factors that go into why **ADBE** might be worth $394 right now, very few of which you are aware.  All you know is that it fell below the SMA 50 on the daily, and currently rests on horizontal support - if it falls below that Support level and **SPY** is down for the day, **ADBE** becomes a good short, if it breaks back above the SMA 50 on the daily and **SPY** is up for the day, **ADBE** becomes a good long.

And for all of those that bought calls on **ADBE** at the close on Friday, because it *has to bounce back up*, well.....good luck with that.

Best, H.S.
