Hello again!

**Introducing ZenBot Scanner "price pop" alerts and scans.** These scans show you tickers that have made a substantial move very recently. A desktop and in-app alert catch your attention and work on the web app ([zenscans.com](https://zenscans.com)) and the [Windows app](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NJXBCJKNBD5).

Larger tickers will alert on sudden moves of 1% over a few M5 bars, while cheap low-float tickers will alert only after a more significant or sudden move. I tried to balance usefulness with "alert overload" (and can tweak this over time if it's too much).

The new [Price Pop - Long](https://www.zenscans.com/Price%20Pops%20-%20Long) and [Prce Pop - Short](https://www.zenscans.com/Price%20Pops%20-%20Short) scans show tickers with recent pops. I've been using this as one of my main stock scanners for day trading.

If you're new to ZenBot Scanner, it is my one-man mission to create the most useful stock scanner for finding relatively strong/weak stocks moving with volume ([launch post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/108mj83/zenbot_scanner_update_new_features/)).

A huge THANK YOU to all the traders using ZenBot Scanner and for all the great feedback and ideas.
