The market has moved through the major moving averages and the down trendlines. On the surface, everything looks great. Unfortunately, the volume is horribly light and that is a sign of low conviction. The big money is not participating to a large degree. They have what they want "on". That is why the volume is light. There is no material change in the backdrop so they are not going to trade wiggles and jiggles. They have a battleship to move.

When the light volume move starts there is a tendency for retail traders to fade the move (short the rally). The thought is that this is fake and it will reverse at various resistance levels. When it continues to move higher, those shorts have to cover (fueling the move higher) and it continues longer than people expect. Eventually, bullish speculators will join the party. They are in "plug your nose and buy mode". They have waited patiently on the sidelines and now they just can't take it any longer. They have "missed such a nice move". Their plan is to bail on the longs at the first sign of trouble. No problem with this strategy, just be nimble and don't over stay your welcome (don't wait for the top).

The point is that these are "weak hands". As soon as the move stalls there will be a swift move lower. The bullish specs get flushed out and the short sellers looking to fade the move will pile in. The big money did not participate in the move higher and they are not aggressive buyers looking to support the drop. The light volume move higher reverses quickly.Â  If it has reached sufficient heights, there might be some bigger money that comes in and smacks the move down. They would view this as a fairly attractive level for shorting. They would also recognize that "weak hands" can easily be flushed out.

**How do you trade it?**

1. Buy the stocks that are leading the charge higher. Right now mega cap tech stocks are strong and that is why the QQQ is strong relative to the SPY.
2. Focus on day trading. Swing trading requires overnights and one bad headline from the banking sector could result in a big overnight drop.
3. Don't spread yourself out across too many symbols. Focus on the strongest stocks with relative strength, heavy volume and technical breakouts D1. If you have to exit you will be able to do so quickly because you are not spread out across a dozen stocks.
4. Set passive targets. If you see bearish hammers or bearish engulfing candles at the high of the day, take your gains and don't look back. Tiny bodied candles and many wicks at the high of the day are also signs of resistance.

I hope this insight helps you.

Trade well.
