The two best ways to identify potentially profitable trades throughout the day are by using *scanners* and *setting alerts.*

It occurred to me that there is no post in the Wiki about *setting alerts*.

**Alerts** are an extremely powerful tool that if done properly can serve up trades to you throughout the day.

You should be setting alerts on charts constantly, but you want to make sure they *mean something* when they are triggered.

For example - lets look at **AAPL**:

**AAPL** has a clear point of resistance here - you have horizontal support which joins with the downward sloping trendline, meeting at $176.45.  Placing an alert on AAPL at $176.50 would give you a very clear buy signal (*market permitting*).

Here is another example - **HD:**

&#x200B;

You'll notice there are a lot of different lines here - you can draw an upward sloping line from the 1/18/2022 Bullish Hammer, a horizontal line of resistance from the *bottom* of 1/14/2022 red candle, which pretty much comes right in at the SMA 100, a downward sloping *Algo* trendline from the *top* of that same candle and an *Algo line* coming in from 1/7/2022.  

What this produces is a clear range from $372 to $376.50, with the SMA 100 sitting right in the middle at $374.  

*The interesting thing about this chart is that it shows that if* ***HD*** *broke through the SMA 100, that alone wouldn't be enough to go Long - it would still need to break above $376.50 -* ***and that is where you put your alert****.* 

Looking at **PHM** we see a very different set-up, providing both a potential *Long* and *Short* opportunity:

**PHM** is definitely bearish right now, it broke through three major SMA's in the past three days - so it is a good short, right?  Not quite - look at the upward sloping *Algo* trendline from 10/1/2021 - twice the price hit that line and bounced above it - right at $49.  An alert below $49 ($48.80 should do it), and a finish below that price would make **PHM** an attractive short.  However, it may also bounce nicely off this support and head back up - where you want to see it once again clear the three SMA's to be considered for a long position.  However, the high volume candle on 1/13/2022 provides you downward sloping *Algo* trendline which is an excellent benchmark to be certain of its' bullish reversal - and thus another alert at $54.30 gives you another potential trade.

Going through your charts, and noting *downward sloping trendline and upward sloping trendlines* ***(Note: trendlines that start with a high volume candle can be considered Algo Lines - downward sloping Algo lines are more powerful than upward sloping ones)****, horizontal levels of support or resistance, and SMA's,* will provide you will excellent points for your alerts.  

Setting roughly 10-20 Alerts a day, both for longs and shorts, puts you in a position where you can have excellent trades suggested at a constant interval.  Naturally, once an alert is triggered, you need to open up that chart, look at the market, and decide if there is a trade present - but if you make sure you alerts are *meaningful* and thus aren't simply triggered by *chop*, more often than not you will find yourself deciding between several potentially profitable ideas at once.
