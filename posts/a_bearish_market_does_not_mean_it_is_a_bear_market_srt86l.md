Since 2020 the number of retails traders have doubled, representing close to 30% of all the liquidity in the market.  This represents a huge influx of inexperience money pouring into equities. Unfortunately, most people today are allergic to history (*which is most likely why we constantly repeat it*), and so their reactions to normal price volatility tend to be....hyperbolic to say the least.

This weekend alone just about every tweet and post I see about the market seems to imply that we have ended a 10+ year Bullish run ,and it is time to get ready to stand in line for a loaf of bread or a block of government issued cheese.

To be fair, the media is only fueling this narrative, because shockingly, headlines that foretell catastrophe, get more clicks than ones of reassurance and calm.   As a result, it every rag financial publication has filled up their pages with headers such as - "***Is the Bubble About to Burst?"*** or ***"Time to Cash In? The Guy That Predicted the Crash of 2008 Say This One Will Be Worse!".***  

Naturally the talking heads on CNBC, who are the human version of an unsalted pretzel, are eager to jump on the BearWagon with their prognostication of doom and gloom.    

So it only makes sense that new traders that have only known two straight years of growth are worried that we are on the verge of a collapse  (*although, honestly, if you know how to trade, balance and hedge, it shouldn't make a difference to you - but for those with Long Term Investments, yes entering into a Bear market* ***would*** *matter).* 

Let's inject a dose of reality into the conversation:

[SPY Weekly Chart](<img src="cache/images/2273fcb764f1148b32cf9f6564ec8f16.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

This is a Weekly Chart on SPY, for the 10 year Bullish Run from 2012 to Present Day - Notice two key indicators:

***Weekly SMA's*** *(Simple Moving Averages) -* The 50, 100, and 200 SMA's are acting like clear guideposts during times of regular volatility.

***Algo Trendlines*** *-* The two upward sloping trendlines are more definitive borders that come into play when the price experiences movement on the extreme ends of the spectrum.

You will see that in 2014 and 2015, **SPY** got over-extended and hit the upward trendline, bouncing down off it several times, spending roughly two years between that upper-bound and the 50-Week SMA.

In late 2015 and early 2016, you will see a period of intense volatility, where **SPY** drops below the 100 Week SMA and goes down to challenge the 200 Week SMA, but never going beneath it.  *Guess what articles back then were saying - Bubble About to Burst! Bear Market Coming!!*  The only difference was there were far fewer retail traders around, and those that were had a lot more experience than the current lot - so those apocalyptic click-bait headlines were in large part, ignored.

After one more visit down the the 100 Week SMA at the end of 2016, **SPY** took off until 2018, where it flirted with the 50 Week SMA a few times, but never crossed it (*notice how precisely the ETF is bouncing off these SMA's and Trendlines btw?*).  

The end of 2019 saw some significant profit-taking, which dropped the market down to the 200 Week SMA for the first time in three years, but it did not last long and the bounce back up was *extreme*.   The summer of 2019 then saw consolidation after huge gains in the first half of the year, and the market bounced around by the 50 Week SMA, until it surged into 2020.

Notice however, that even as we have dramatic growth heading into the COVID crash, we still never came close to the upper-bound of the trendlines.  And then in March 2020 the market crashed down below the all the Weekly SMA's, and for the first time in 10 years, broke through the lower-bound of the trend-line corridor.  Which made sense, everyone thought we were about to reenact Stephen King's *The Stand*. 

We all know what happened next, because chances are - that is where most of you entered the picture. 

Constant growth that kept **SPY** well above the 50 Week SMA, with only small dips that were quickly recovered. 

That bring us to today - look at the chart - where are we?  Are we at the 100 Week SMA? The 200? The lower trendline?  ***No - we can't even breakthrough the 50 Week SMA convincingly. We are not even close to the worse moments of the Bull run of the past 10+ years.***

Here's a closer look:

Even when you zoom in and draw a closer trendline - you can see **SPY** still respecting both the trendline and the SMA 50.

When looking at these two charts - does *anything* about them scream - *Bear Market Coming! ?*

***What you should see is SPY still in the upper-half of its' 10-Year corridor, respecting support levels and not presenting any serious challenge to the lower range of the decade long Bull Run.***

***All of this is with High Inflation, raising Interest Rates, potential of War in the Ukraine, possible social disruption during the elections, and a pandemic that is STILL impacting the economy.  With all of that bad news currently priced in, where are we?  Again, nowhere near the lower half of the corridor.***

So the next time you see someone start screaming about entering a Bear Market - remember this post.  Also bear in mind (yes pun, intended, and yes, it deserves every eye-roll you are giving it), in order to turn a 10+ year Bull market into a Bear, one needs a *Credit Crisis* of significant magnitude.  And I am not saying that such an occurrence is impossible or will not happen - I am simply saying - *It is not currently happening.*

Will we experience volatility for awhile? Most likely.  But for now, Bears can stay in hibernation.

Best, H.S.
