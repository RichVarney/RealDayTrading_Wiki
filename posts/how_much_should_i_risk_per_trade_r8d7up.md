**All of it.  Some of it. Just a small amount.**

What should the risk/reward be?

**Don't know. Don't care. Never used it.**

***In other words - Stop It.***

Yes, I know you read all the books, and they all say you should only risk 1-2% per trade.  

And yes, you read all about the risk/reward ratio and how you need to be aware of it to set your stops accordingly.

Guess what? 

*Everyone else has also read those books or been told those rules.  Everyone else tries to implement them.  Everyone else also loses their money.*  

*Institutions are also aware of where you are putting that stop, and their algorithms are specifically designed to trigger them.  And no, they aren't targeting* ***you*** *specifically, it is just that "you" are acting just like "everyone else", so when they trigger your stop, they are triggering* ***a lot*** *of stops.*  

Let's start with: **How much should you risk per trade?**

To begin with, most people get this wrong - *You are only risking what you are willing to lose.*  If I have an account with $40,000 in it and I buy 1,000 shares of AAPL at $160, am I risking $160,000 (including my 4X buying power)  **NO.**  Am I risking the original $40,000? **NO.** I am only risking up to my stop (hard or mental)  - so if my stop is at $159, then I am risking $1,000.  

It always has me shaking my head when I hear someone say, "So you risked $160,000 to make $1,000? That's a terrible deal, why would you do that??"  As if I am willing to let the stock go to $0, as if the stock *could* actually go to $0.  But, alas, some people actually believe this to be the case.  

I am going to safely assume you all get the concept that you are only risking what you are willing to lose - the question remains: what is the acceptable level to risk?  

The answer doesn't lie in your account balance.  It is in the charts, and constantly changing.   Let's take  **HPQ** \- Hewlett Packard (for some reason whenever I hear this company's name, I think of shit you used to buy at Radio Shack) as an example, let's say you bought 1,000 shares today at $38.25.

And for the sake of this example, you have a $50,000 account and you don't risk more than 2% per trade.  Which means once **HPQ** hit $37.25 today, you are out of the trade - down $1,000.

However, let's look at the daily chart:

And now the daily chart using Heikin Ashi candles:

In other words - other than your risk tolerance, there is no reason to drop this trade.   Even though the market was extremely bearish today the stock still finished up .12 cents overall, has no resistance above, and over the last week **SPY** declined roughly 2.1% while **HPQ** increased 11%.  

Given that sellers could not drive **SPY** below $450 today, and the market finished with a bullish flourish, you can feel fairly safe in swinging a strong stock, and that is exactly what **HPQ** is - a strong stock.

***You cannot let your P&L dictate your trading strategy.***   

Exiting this trade because of an arbitrary "loss tolerance" completely removes whatever edge you might have in trading, as half of your success depends on when you exit a trade.  Think of all the thought you put into finding the stock, and then making sure you made the right entry (or perhaps you put in no thought at all and just saw some go long **HPQ**) - all of that is negated when you exit a trade simply for financial reasons. 

You need to size your positions so you can focus solely on the technical signals that tell you when to exit. The catch-22 of course is that if your position is too small, while you're able to focus solely on the charts, the resulting profit (or loss) isn't enough to matter.  However, if your position is too large, even though the result can have a significant impact, it is that very impact that prevents you from properly trading.

So what do you do?  How can you stop this insidious behavior that throws away your money and leaves you feeling hollow inside?  

Glad you asked - because I have an answer for you:

Every day you should be uploading your trades into your online journal and tagging each one with the set-up you used (i.e. *Good Daily Chart, Relative Strength, Strong Volume, Bullish Market, Break of Consolidation to the Upside on the Daily*).  

Over time, you will be able to see what percent of time those set-ups produce a profit.  Furthermore you can annotate them with whether or not they fell into negative territory (i.e. *Down 30%* at one point) - this is your Max Drawdown metric if you will.  You can use this to see how often trades that were in the negative bounced back to become profitable.

What if you knew that over 80% of the time positions that dropped because of a steep market decline, but still remained strong to the market overall, or stocks that are on a upward bullish trend and at the all-time-high - wound up not only recovering, but hitting your profit target?  And 10% of the time, you broke even?

If you knew that swinging this stock resulted in a loss only 10% of the time, would you close the trade?

The more faith you have in your set-ups, the easier it will be to ignore your P&L.  And there isn't a successful trader out there that bases their decisions on how much they are willing risk.

But wait....how can you figure out what your Risk:Reward ratio will be before entering the trade?  

*You can't.*  

*And you shouldn't.*  

Your set-ups determine your Risk:Reward, not your entry and stops.  Once again, look at your journal - the set-ups that do not result in a profitable outcome should either be refined or removed from your trading method.   

Going into a trade thinking - I need to get a 1 to 2 Risk-Reward, so I am going to put a stop at .50 cents loss and target at $1 profit, is quite possibly of the most the inane methods of trading imaginable.  At this point why even bother looking at the chart or price action?

*Master a winning strategy, refine the strategy to increase your win rate - your profit ratio is a by-product of that.*  

If you have a winning strategy, but you find that you are not making enough profit per trade, that it is a matter of analyzing why you are exiting the trade too soon. Because if there is no possible way to exit trades later when implementing your strategy (i.e. you always exit close to the top) then it is *not a good method.* Simple as that.

Trying to force a profit ratio into the trade is like putting the cart before the horse.

So basically, what I am trying to tell you, in a long-winded kind of way - *Stop focusing on your account balance!* 

Best, H.S.
