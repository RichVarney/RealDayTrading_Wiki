Learning the method(s) that are required to be a consistently profitable trader is not terribly difficult.  Don't get wrong, it is not like you can just breeze through it and load up your account ready to take on the market, you can't.  It takes time and effort, but still, it is a *learned skill*.  If one puts in that time and effort, there is no reason they should not be able to know the methods/strategies taught.

However, Method without Mindset will get you nowhere.  In fact, if you have Method without Mindset you will just be a well-educated trader that still loses money. Having the right mindset is essential, unfortunately it is also what takes the most time and represents the biggest obstacle most people can't seem to get over.

The Wiki goes into extensive detail on the various Mindset issues traders tend to have and offers practical solutions on how to address them.  The ten-steps that every trader is suggested to take is in fact designed to slowly reset your way of thinking over time.

Despite the large amount of coverage Mindset gets in the Wiki there is one issue that I have errantly glossed over and want to address here - Personal Responsibility.

In general most of us suck at this.  Even worse - we think we are pretty good at taking Personal Responsibility when we aren't, which makes it even harder to fix.

This deflection of responsibility is pervasive in our lives.

Notice how when someone gets into a car accident it is almost *never* their fault?

Lose a job? Well, the boss must have been an incompetent asshole, right? The policies there were unreasonable I am sure!

Break-up with your partner? Clearly their fault, I mean obviously. Even if you are the one that cheated, anyone can see that they drove you to that.  If they were a remotely a good partner you wouldn't have had to cheat! Makes total sense.  Even better is when someone tries to assign percentages to the blame, as if they deserve a medal for taking a minority stake in fucking up (e.g., "It was like 70-30 their fault!")

Stuck in rut? Can't improve your life? Well who can with the way the system is and "The Man" that is always trying to keep you down!!

Now, don't get me wrong, there are some legitimate obstacles that are well outside ones control.  If you are living on the street screaming at shadows because you suffer from schizophrenia, you need help that you can't provide yourself.

There are also clear institutional biases that make the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness more difficult for some than for others.  As someone that was homeless as a kid and grew up with absolutely none of the advantages that money brings, I obviously had a more difficult road to success than some trust-fund brat. Still, would have I been able to get where I am today if I was born a black female rather than a white male? I don't know, but I do know it would have been a fuck ton harder.

Still, putting these systemic grievances aside, most people tend to side-step taking responsibility for their lives.  Like anything else, this bleeds into our trading.

On occasion there are some trades that despite doing everything right still manage to turn into a bad loss, however these are actually pretty *rare*.  Most of the time we fucked up.  Sometimes it is obvious and other times we have dig a bit to find it, but generally it is there - that is unless you are unwilling to see it.

I have heard every possible excuse and found that they can range from the extreme to almost reasonable.

**Extreme:** These people tend to think there is some huge conspiracy that for some reason, known only to them I suppose, are specifically targeting their trades.  Sometimes it is the "Algos" that just know how to make sure they take your money, and at other times it is literally a person on the other end that is countering their every move (while wearing an eye-patch I guess).    The slightly less extreme version of this is claiming that the "System" in general is designed to make sure that "You" lose.  It can't be their fault for failing at trading when there was no way they could ever win to begin with, right?

**Chaos:** While not nearly as wackadoo insane as the *Extreme* group, people in this category love to blame the random and chaotic nature of the market that always seems to turn against them.  Ironically by defining the randomness as always being the cause of their failure they are, in a way, saying it is not random at all.  "Everything was going fine until for no reason at all the market decided to drop out of nowhere and it totally wiped my position out."  Why didn't they close it? Why was their position size too large? Could have they held it and waited for the market to reverse? Did the stock have the Relative Strength to withstand the drop? Was their positions expiration far enough out to weather any "noise" intraday? Was the daily chart still bullish despite the intraday move?  We will never know the answer to these questions because they all require a degree of introspection that they don't have.  If it is random, it is out of their control, and if it is out of their control it can't be their fault, right? Right! Moving on....

**Gambler:** I have a special place in my heart for the gambler, for I was/am one.  In the immortal words of The Color of Money - Money Won *is* Twice as Sweet as Money Earned.  Let's face it, gambling is fun, it gives us a rush that well-thought out trades do not.  Sometimes we even win! Most of the time we don't, but let's not think about those times, those are bad times.  We are all going to gamble from time to time, although some more than others.  As long as you admit it, then go ahead, say, "I feel like gambling here and am going to take some OTM NVDA Puts!"  But we don't say that, do we?  We call it a "Spec Trade", or try to justify it with a bunch of TA that starts to become almost surreal - "It was on an upward trend on the M30 and the EMA7 crossed the EMA34 with above average volume, and the last time I saw this pattern while SPY was chopping around, the stock dropped like a rock!"  Un huh...look, just say you were gambling.  You'll find that simply by taking responsibility and admitting it, the behavior itself will begin to decline.

**Life:** Ah, this special person has just so many things going on in their life that it is hard to trade! All of us have perfect lives of course with no interruptions or worries, but this person is different, their life is HELL.  They have this job that takes up all their time, and the kids, my god the kids they just won't stop, plus did you know about all their medical issues? No? Well they will gladly tell you! Because there is so many medical issues.  With all of that, it is amazing they can manage to trade at all.  So yeah, they were distracted and did not close that position when they should have, and of course they missed the fact that SPY was dropping when they went long AAPL, how could they see that when little Suzie is screaming for dinner!?!

**The Unlucky Repeat Offender:** Perhaps the most frustrating of them all....they fuck up, they acknowledge they fucked up, they say they learned from the fuck up, and then....yeah, you know - they fuck up again **exactly the same damn way**.  This trader doesn't really believe they are at fault.  Instead they pay lip service to whomever is calling them out, claiming that of course they read the Wiki, but hey, they'll read it again (Narrator: They never read it).  You can't get mad at them because....they're "trying".  Who wants to yell at a little trooper like this? Anyone?  The problem here is you can't get through to this person because even though they say they know they are at fault, they really believe they were just "unlucky".  Even though they can somehow manage to be "unlucky" so many times in a row that it is statistically impossible, they will keep on believing it, even as they say, "I know, I know, I messed up...back to the Wiki I guess!"

Edit:  
**The Bad Man Made Me!** How can I forget this one? This is where you followed another trader into a trade, lost and then blame the other trader.  First off, you should not be following a trade, but even if you do, that trade is **your** responsibility.  It isn't the responsibility of the other trader to hold your hand and help you through, or to guide you on the exit - again, it is **your** trade. So stop fucking whining and start finding your own trades! Whew, there....got that one in.

**Changin Times:** Finally we have the excuse that while back in the day one could use TA to trade, in todays age with all those damn Algos and 0DTE Options, and the kids out there with their Sony Walkmans and video game machines, nothing is simple anymore.   It's just broken now and there is no way to fix it.  They'll be damned if they are going to try to beat a broken system!  They'll say this about once a week as they keep doing the same thing over and over.  At some point I am sure they will tell some kids to get off their damn lawn.

Sometimes you can get a person that combines various traits from all of these categories, which is always a treat.  The "It's all rigged, one big Ponzi scheme, and there is no logic to it anyway! There used to be perhaps, but not anymore!" trader.

The road to becoming a successful trader is filled with mistakes, sometimes huge mistakes.  The system taught here is meant to at least have you go through that process with as little financial damage as possible, but the mistakes are part of the learning.  In fact, recognizing those errors, putting them in your journal and then each month reducing the how often they occur is essential to moving forward.

Until you are able to take responsibility for your mistakes, understand why they occurred, whether it is psychological or technical in nature, and then work towards fixing them, one cannot ever reach their desired destination of being a financially independent consistently profitable trader.

Best, H.S.
