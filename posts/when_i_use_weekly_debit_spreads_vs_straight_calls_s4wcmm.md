I have done a post on using debit spreads using weekly expiration dates as effective day trades or short term overnight trades. [Using Debit Spreads as a Profitable Day Trading Strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/or3o22/using_debit_spreads_a_profitable_day_trading/) \- [u/onewyse](https://www.reddit.com/u/onewyse)

I have had several traders ask me when i use debit spreads vs straight calls or puts. I use a couple of criteria to make that determination, keeping mind for a debit spread you must have a bullish bias on the stock both on the 5 min and daily charts.

1. If i want to reduce the cost of the trade due to the premiums being very high (on stocks like TSLA AMZN GOOGL etc) Those straight calls or puts can cost $2000 or more per contract and may create too much risk for a trader so a debit spread expiring the current week is a great alternative.
2. On stocks with wide bid ask spreads. Wide bid ask spreads while most traders consider these to be too risky and difficult to get out of i have found that if you enter an order with a price well below 50% of the spread between your long option and your short option (IE 1.90 - 2.00 for a $5 wise spread) many times you will get a great fill and can immediately enter a sell order .25 to .30 higher and get filled on any move up. If you think about what happens with wide bid ask spreads, if a trader enters a market order for one of the legs included in your order the chance of then getting a great fill on the order is very good. This is also what helps you get a good fill on your exit if a market order is entered for one of the legs of your exit order. I usually just put an order out there and wait. You may not get filled so no loss and look for another. Of course stock selection is critical and your bias on the stock needs to be correct.
3. On slower moving stocks that are grinding up and arent likely to push through your short strike very quickly so that the time decay is working in your favor more quickly.

I generally use straight calls or puts with deltas of .65 to .75 if

1. I want to have more time for the trade and will go out 2 or 3 weeks or more on the expiration
2. A stock with tight bid ask spreads and low volatility. These options usually have a lot of intrinsic value in the options and will give you more profit than a debit spread may on those stocks.

Credit spreads are also an option but they fall into a different category and can be used in addition to the debit spread or straight calls or puts.

This is a general overview of what i look for before taking a debit spread or straight call or put trade but remember to also take market trend and action into consideration and try to take trades that correspond to the current market trend and have relative strength or weakness to the indexes so you will have the greatest chance for follow through.
