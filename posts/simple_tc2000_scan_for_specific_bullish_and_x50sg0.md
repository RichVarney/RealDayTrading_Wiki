This is a fairly basic TC2000 scan to find some good bullish and bearish setups on the daily chart. I use the results to find good continuation trades the following day when i scan in the evening and for the current day for potential overnight trades to hold. The number of results are fairly small but effective.  

The bullish scan is looking for stocks above the 50 sma, volume above the 50 day avg, price above the high of the last 50 days and price over $5. The Bearish scan results are below the 50 sma and below a 50 day low. The parameters can be modified to meet your requirements.
