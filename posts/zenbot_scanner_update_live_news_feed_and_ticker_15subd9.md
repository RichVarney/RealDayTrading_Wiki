Hey there!

I launched a few new ZenBot Scanner toys: **live news and ticker search**.  If you're new to ZenBot Scanner, it's my one-man mission to create the most useful and delightful stock scanner for the RDT community ([launch post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/108mj83/zenbot_scanner_update_new_features/)).

**Live News Feed**

I've been trading more news catalysts lately and realized that a scanner that includes news would be very powerful. I spent the weekend adding a news feed to the scanner.

* The icon highlights in red or green if there is news today
* Hover over the icon for news
* New [Up On News](https://www.zenscans.com/Up%20On%20News) and [Down on News](https://www.zenscans.com/Down%20On%20News) scans show trending tickers with a possible news catalyst.

**Ticker search**

Lots of you have asked for this! Type in a ticker and quickly see everything in one place. View technical analysis, links to all the scans that include the ticker, and news.

I'm finding the "scans that include ticker" a fascinating double-check when deciding what to trade. At a glance, you might see the ticker is 'down on news', through a D1 SMA break, has high relative volume, and is near premarket lows.

I hope these new features help! Please consider a [Patreon subscription,](https://www.patreon.com/zenbot) as my server and data costs are getting quite high. Thanks again!
