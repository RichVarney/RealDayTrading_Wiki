So a few weeks ago I posted some trade criteria but I realized that was only a small help if you can't get the market right. I'm not a pro but I've been trying to work on the exact same criteria system for reading the market and this is the best thing I've got so far:

Using this little spreadsheet checkbox has helped me learn how to read price action better and internalize a lot of it so I can tell a lot about **how** price is moving. That gives clues as to how  you should trade that day

I took a look at all of the ways to read price action. Volume, candles, HA trend etc and organized them in a way that makes more sense. **Big help from Pete over at 1Option.** His videos and chatroom feedback has helped me HUGE to read price action and that alone is worth the price. You should watch all of his stuff

**Disclaimer -**

This WONT tell you if you're having a bear/bull day or if you'll get a reversal. You'll have to look at the bigger story for that. But it WILL let you know how the price action is unfolding and help you keep your monkey brain superstitions out of your head.

**How it works -**

It scores from -9 to +9 and ranges from trend - chop - pure chop. Using that score you can decide how big a position to risk, maybe when you should take profits or just hold etc. Also when NOT to trade. It's helped me a ton and you can do whatever you like with it.

*if you don't have the 1op indicator just ignore the top and bottom criteria and the "flat/janky 1op" criteria*

*(use the opposite for bear/short)*

**Upward price movement** \- duh is it going up?**Higher pivot lows** \- on the 5' chart are the pullbacks ending higher than the last ones?**Bottoms wicks > top wicks?** \- is there more overall combined bottom "wickage" on the 5' candles?**Last 3x HA candles were green** \- were the last three 5' HA candles that happened in a row green?**Last defended long candle was green** \- was the last longer than average candle that *didn't* get defeated green? (defeated = retraced over 50% or 100%, basically negated)**Higher RVOL on green candles** \- look at the volume bars, is there more overall higher green ones?**Last 3 stacked candles were green** \- were the last 3 candles with minimal overlap in a row green?**Bullish divergence last cycle (1op only)** \- was the 1op indicator in a bear cross but the price action didn't really move down, and now it's back in a bull cross? This is turbo time.

&#x200B;

**Compression** \- if the market is in compression or not, this should push your score back 1 (maybe even back to 0) and tells you maybe don't do anything yet

**Low daily RVOL** \- this means that ALL of the movement today is untrustworthy and you should risk accordingly. I push the score back towards 0 by 1 point at least

I update this every few candles just to keep an OBJECTIVE bead on the price action and it's awesome. Use it however you like. you can weight stuff more or less on the data tab or change your criteria. You can also have certain trades, exits, rules etc that are only valid in trends or chop etc and that adds more discipline to your strategy. For example I'll only hold through a pullback if the market is +7 or above but you have to make your own rules.

Hope this helps!
