I recorded this video almost two weeks ago on August 4th and it is almost an hour long. This was just before I took time off so I wanted to give traders a short-term and a long term market outlook. The technical analysis was detailed and I described what the candles were telling me. Then I zeroed in on individual stocks (long and short) and I provided the same technical analysis. The beauty of watching this video now is that the lessons are still valid and you can see if I was able to predict price movement.

For those of you who think I get rich on my YouTube videos, Google pays me less than $20 per video and that does not even cover the cost of the thumbnail. I am recording them to help you!
