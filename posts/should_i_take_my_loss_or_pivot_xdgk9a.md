When you enter a trade you do so based on sound analysis (marked checkboxes). Normally (90% of the time) you should not pivot. If you are doing it more often than that, your original analysis is weak and it needs improvement or market conditions are so volatile that you should only be day trading.

When your original analysis is sound, you should take your lumps and move on. If you are trading stock, it is hard for the stock to instantly flip from bullish to bearish and even if you are forced to stop out, chances are you can find a better stock to short than the one you were in.

This morning I recorded a video two hours before the open. I mentioned that I am only day trading because I have no clue of what the market is going to do a week out and there are plenty of intraday opportunities so I can't justify taking overnight risk.

I outlined all of the reasons why I wanted to favor the long side today and I found my "pick of the day". By the time I had rendered the video and uploaded it to YouTube the S&P 500 had staged a 70 point reversal. The market had not even opened and it was reacting to the CPI. All of the reasons I was bullish vaporized and I had to adjust my bias.

The SPY had broken the major MAs I was leaning on right on the open and the price action confirmed that we were going to have a bearish trend day. It was going to take a massive move to change all of the things that originally made me bullish going into the day and we got that big move.

You should not pivot often. It is a sign that your original analysis was weak. Secondly, know when you are wrong and take your lumps. Lastly, in the event that conditions change materially, take the other side and lick your wounds later. This will be hard to do, but if all of the reasons for your bias just left the room and you can now justify taking the other side with confidence - do it.

I hope this helps some of you in these volatile times and there is a nice bearish pick in the video that is setting up well.
