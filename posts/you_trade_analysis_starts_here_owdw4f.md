No matter how much I stress this concept, its importance is discounted by most traders. A week ago I had a conversation with a frustrated trader. He told me that right when he thought he had figured everything out it turned to #$%\^ during the last 5 days. I asked him, “What changed?”

He had gone through his trade logs and after unsuccessfully taking multiple stabs at the possible problem, I pointed him in the right direction. I asked him, “What did the market do in the last week and what did it do the week before?”

The market tested the 50-day MA two weeks ago and it bounced. Once the market rebound stalled at the all-time high the trading ranges collapsed last week and conditions became much more difficult. Traders who failed to recognize that gave back all or most of the gains from the prior week. 

EVERYTHING starts with the market. This can’t be a secondary thought, it has to be front and center stage. The market has been in a strong uptrend for 15 months and the best opportunities will come on market pullbacks. Those market dips give you an opportunity to easily identify stocks with relative strength on the way down and when the market finds support you will have an opportunity to join the uptrend with the best stocks on the rebound. After a drop to the 50-day MA the SPY will make sustained moves and you can ride the trades for bigger gains. This backdrop sets up for fertile hunting and trading seems so easy.

In addition to evaluating the longer term backdrop, day traders also need to evaluate the current day’s price action. That sets the table for how you will approach the day and it will determine if you are trading from the long side or the short side. Last Friday I recorded this video a few hours after the open. I predicted that the high was in for the SPY and that it would make a new low for the day. That was correct and that information was extremely useful.

When you are evaluating your trades you should note market conditions. In my opinion you need to start your daily trade analysis with the market. How well/poorly did you forecast market movement? If you are consistently getting the market wrong, focus on improving that element of your trading. When your market analysis improves everything will fall into place.

Imagine standing in the tee box of your favorite par 5 and you have a 30 mph headwind. It’s obvious that you need to temper your expectations and you need to adjust your game plan for the hole. The fact that you birdied it last week has no bearing on what your score will be today. Trading is exactly the same.
