This strategy seems to work consistently enough so I thought I would share it.

Critique away, I have not back-tested it and my success could be purely anecdotal.  However, the math seems to work fairly well.

First find a range bound but volatile stock.  TSLA is a decent example so I’ll use that.  On average TSLA tends to move +/- $15 a week (earnings week aside).

For the ease of the example let’s assume TSLA opens on Monday at 385.  Let’s also assume that next week won’t be apocalyptically unpredictable.  In other words, I would probably wait a week before doing this again, but the last five weeks have paid off.

In this case I would do the first butterfly of 355/370/385, which right now is a debit of $3.65 per contract and max gain of $11.35.   Meaning anything over a 24% success rate makes this trade profitable.

Next I do a 385/400/415 for a debit of $5.55 and a max gain of $9.45 per contract.  Meaning anything over a 37% success rate makes this trade profitable.

I am paying a total of $9.20 for both trades.

Obviously if I let both trades run down until closing on Friday, I would need one of these two to come in.

However, I am not letting them both run down.  Butterflies stay fairly neutral until roughly 2 days before expiration barring some massive move outside the range.  

So this is what I have been doing - if by Wednesday TSLA has started to edge towards the upper butterfly, I shut down the middle of the middle of the 355/370/385 and let the 355 & 385 calls run, while keeping the 385/400/415 running intact. 

If TSLA starts edging toward the lower butterfly I keep the middle of the 385/400/415 and drop the calls on the wings.

Thus, unless there is some significant reversal on Thursday or Friday, I have one fully intact butterfly working and the stock heading towards it directionally, and one broken butterfly becoming increasingly profitable. 

With a total risk of $920 the chance of hitting maximum loss in minimal given the mid-week adjustment.  

Five weeks in a row and this strategy had paid off every time.

Thoughts?
