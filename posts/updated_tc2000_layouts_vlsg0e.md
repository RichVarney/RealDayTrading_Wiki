If you have TC2000 here are the most recent layouts that I've been using. The homemade relative strength indicator based off Hari's post is included.

Green line = stock RS/RW  
Yellow line = sector RS/RW  
Blue line = SPY RS/RW

I don't trade stocks under 1m avg volume, 10$, or 1B market cap. The reason is that anything under these levels tends to trade differently and not react to RS/RW readings the same.  


**All longs are above yesterdays highs, and all shorts are below yesterdays low**

**HOD/LOD** \- use all the time, this is your main $ maker

**+/- VWAP** \- use when SPY is pulling back but your thesis is the same. lets you get the jump on stocks

**SMA Breaks** \- stocks crossing above/below 50, 100, or 200sma

**Compression** \- stocks breaking above/below at least 5 days compression (new one, might need work)

**ATL/ATL** \- kind of like a d1 hod/low works well on certain SPY days

**HA continuation** \- D1 charts with at least 3 flat sided HA candles in a row

**HA reversal** \- Flat HA, doji, opposite flat HA pattern. These often break downsloping trendline/algos

**Volume** \- shows longs/short intraday's that are popping with 5' candle volume right now

**Liquid Options** \- stocks with great option liquidity. Good for swings/spreads

I always sort results by **Volume Buzz**. This is basically RVOL in tc2000
