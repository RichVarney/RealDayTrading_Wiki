You hear this all the time - *You need an edge to be successful*.

*So what does that mean?*

Literally it means - Having a statistical advantage in the outcome being in your favor.

**For example:** There is no edge in flipping a coin. If it is flipped correctly, you have a 50/50 outcome.

When you have no edge, or if the edge is against you - and you are wagering money on the outcome, it is known as *gambling*.

In almost every game offered (except for Poker, and in rare instances Blackjack) the casino has an *edge*, but it is not a huge one - only 1-2% in their favor.  But that slight edge is enough to ensure that if enough players with enough money engage with their games, they will be profitable.  In large quantities, it doesn't take a large *edge* to matter.  In fact, those games are constructed in such a way to allow for the smallest possible *edge* to the casino while remaining in profit.  Why? If their *edge* was any greater, people wouldn't play.  People need to feel like they *can* win, and sometimes *do* win, otherwise even the worst gambler would stay away.

Sometimes you can obtain an *edge* through information.  But information can be tricky.  Many gamblers believe that by studying the conditions of a horse race (the jockey, the track, the horse) they can beat the odds.  They don't - because they never fully realize that their *edge* is mitigated by those very odds.  In other words - it is *baked in* to the odds on the horse.  There is nothing they can learn that the odds makers don't already know.  This is similar to those that believe they can outthink the *Institutional* buyers in the market by coming up with some theory on a stock - without realizing that even if they were correct, that information would already be *baked into* the price of the stock.  However, if information you have, is not readily available to anyone else, it *can* provide an edge - but as many of you know this is usually *illegal* and referred to as *inside information*.   For example, studying all the information I can about two football teams is not going to help me is overcoming the odds already set on the game - however, if I knew that the quarterback of one team was having medical issues and that information wasn't public, then yes, I would have an *edge*.

Unlike a casino the market is a level-playing field.  As much as we like to muse about how it is *fixed* against us, it really isn't. Market dynamics does not play favorites - if you go long on **AAPL**, you are taking a position opposite of someone else who is hoping **AAPL** goes down.  If you are buying a Call Option, someone else is selling that Option.  Do some have an advantage? Yes - clearly. Members of Congress for example have outperformed the market consistently - that is not a coincidence.  That is most likely an *edge* due to *information* that is not readily available.  However, *Institutional* buyers and sellers also tend to out-perform everyone - once again, not a coincidence.  But for them, it is not about illegally obtained information (in fact, it is extremely regulated) - rather it is because they are able to *out-analyze* everyone else because they have more *resources* to do so.

There are two things that can give you an *edge* in this market: Analysis and Skill.

Institutions can out-analyze everyone else simply because they have more data and more resources to analyze that data.  That's it.  The average retail trader cannot afford to purchase the information they can, and do not have access to the data-scientists and computing power they do. Hence, they have an *edge*.

So what is your *edge?*

Well if you go on YouTube, or look across the subs on Reddit, everyone claims to have found some secret method that can put the odds in your favor.  As I hope you know by now, they are all pretty much full of shit.

Trying to come up with your own *edge* is a foolish endeavor.  Back-test all you want.  Write whatever code you want to write that automates your trading.  In the end, you are going to wind up shaking your head wondering how something with such a high win-rate didn't work.   Use all the indicators you can use, and once again you will drive yourself crazy trying to figure out where you went wrong.

So what is the *answer*?  And why does this sub proclaim to know it where all the others have failed?

The answer is right in front of our faces - *Institutions have an edge*.  They have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing that *edge* and use it constantly. Retail traders do not move the market, they do.

What professional traders have figured out is that instead of trying to figure out how to predict the markets, you need to figure out how to follow *Institutions*.

That is what *Relative Strength* and *Relative Weakness* **really** does.  It alerts you towards concentrated *Institutional* efforts in an equity position.  And **that** is your edge.

For example: let's say the market is flat, basically chopping around.  That doesn't mean *Institutions* aren't buying and selling - they are - they just don't have a unified bias in any one direction.  When all economic indicators converge on a bullish sentiment, *Institutions* typically act as one - all accumulating equities, and increasing their stakes.  You can see what sectors they are favoring or not simply by looking at a heatmap of the S&P on any given day.

**But** when one stock seems to be out-performing (using a bullish example) everything else, that is the clue you need to hitch a ride on their *edge*.  Back to the example - if **SPY** is flat, and tech stock are similarly flat, but **AAPL** continues to go up - that tells you that *Institutions* are actively increasing their stake in that stock, in greater proportion to other stocks.  *It is independent of the general market sentiment*.  Meaning if **SPY** were to drop, the reason why *Institutions* were accumulating **AAPL** on that day most likely will not have changed - so **AAPL** is not going to drop at the same rate at **SPY**.  Yes, the buying may slow down as traders start to turn bearish, even temporarily, but you still know that **AAPL** is going to give you an *edge* that other equities will not.

*Relative Strength* in this instance cleared away the **noise** in the market and *controlled* for all the irrelevant information allowing you to see the independent strength of that stock.  Hence, you can now act on that information.

Will you always run slightly behind the *Institutions?* Yes - that is why we confirm rather than anticipate.  They get to have the first part of the move, but all you want to do is ride on their coattails, until you see signs that they are no longer focusing their money into that trade.  They might make $2 a share and you might only take $1 off it, but that $1 is still your *edge.*

In a sense, your *edge* is their *edge*, only less.  But when even a small *edge* can lead to that is all you need.

Honing this ability is the *skill* part of the equation, and this sub is all about teaching you that skill.

Best, H.S.
