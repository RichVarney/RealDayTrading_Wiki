The stocks that I scalp are mostly momentum plays, but they MUST have the following Characteristics:

1. The stock MUST have relative strength to the SPY on the 5M chart. I use [Oneoption.com](https://oneoption.com/) to track that.
2. The stock must be trading at a minimum of 1.2 Relative Volume, but the higher the better.
3. I like stocks that have gapped up out of the block on momentum (use various custom scanners), then pulled back to a 8 day EMA on the 5M. I will enter half around the 8 day EMA (on a green candle once the 8 day has been tested) and will add on a test of HOD, and then look to sell into a big green candle. my mental stop is a negative cross of the 3/8 day EMA (so size accordingly) or a print below VWAP (whichever occurs first). I have been trading LEXX, CEMI MEDS, today and traded NURO yesterday doing that.
4. Stocks should be trading ABOVE the VWAP on the 5 day when scalping.
5. I DO NOT CARRY any low float Momentum stocks over night as I worry about dilution. I missed on NURO yesterday as I bought it 8.15 (8 day ema on a pull back from 12), but then called a test of the HOD $12.90 which it did at 25 min later for a nice $4.50 gain. too bad it is trading at $30+ today.
6. Scalping is a BIG MENTAL game, and you have to be willing to take a loss, most scalpers (or traders) fail because they cant take the loss. I cant say it enough - SIZE ACCORDINGLY! 
7. I get 10 emails a day on When do you take the profit? if I could give you a solid answer I would be a BILLIONAIRE. I like selling into strength (big green candles), I have learned how to read the candles (and this is one of the first things you should learn). I also position my size that allows me to scale in or out, and I size it, so that if I take a max loss (negative 3/8 cross or below Vwap), I am comfortable with it.  
8. Some misc:  The key to a profitable scalp is a  good entry, which is an obvious statement - but so many people chase and get burned.  Remember with a SCALP,  you are only in the trade short term and you don't allow the trade to work as much as you would a swing trade. Use your technical  (i.e a pull back to the day EMA) or whatever else works for you. Point being don't throw a dart.  force yourself to use Rules on an entry and then the profits will increase.  Keep an eye on the volume, if you see diminishing volume then the stock is most likely going to go down. 

Here is an example of a trade today: 

&#x200B;

LEXX popped up on a momentum scanner.  stock had RS vs the SPY right out of the gate. waited on a pull back to the 8 day EMA which occurred at 9.57 around 10:15 Am (5M chart) limped in at 1/4 position at 9:60, . waited for a green candle which was the next candle; entered another 3/4 at 10.17,  added another  1/4  the high of day 11:08  at 10:15. Sold into strength at 11.80.
