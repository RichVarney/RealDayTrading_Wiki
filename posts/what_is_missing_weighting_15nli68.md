There is no doubt in my mind that this community has a *significantly* higher success rate than any other trading method out there.

In a poll posted here ([Success Rate Poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/155tog8/community_poll_trading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) over 86% report *improvement* in their trading, 7% have improved to the point of being full-time and close to 30% are there or within 6-months of that goal.

Even if there is a high level of exaggeration (which I never understand why in anonymous polls, but whatever, it happens), this is still *far superior* than any other place.

Add to that all the testimonials we have seen, and one can easily conclude that while this is very difficult....it works.

Still, I am concerned.  Far too many continue to lose money.  Not only do they lose money, but so many of them fall prey to the exact same mindset issues.  Perhaps it is because they are the loudest group their number seems oversized, but it's not just that.  *They continue to think they are right!*  That is truly the most amazing thing.  I recall teaching university Freshman and Sophomores Introduction to Statistics, and like every Intro Stats class the *Monty Hall* problem would come up.  It was always those students that could barely add that argued the most vociferously that the choice was 50/50.

It may be that there is nothing to be done here - and there will always be that unreachable group of people.  However, recently I took a trade on **MRNA** (on 8/9/2023) and to me this trade was obvious - the stock is sitting on two different major lines of support, it tested that support three times, rebounded on the third test with Relative Strength and high Relative Volume, it had a clear stop of $99 and huge upside.  It was literally the essence of what the Wiki teaches.  Despite this, there was confusion among some...not just confusion but outright anger even - "This is not in the Wiki, this is against what the Wiki teaches!"

How could there be such a disconnect?  It nagged at me.  And when something nags at me, I don't let it go. Not until I solve it.

Well, I am pretty sure I solved it.

It is a matter of *weighting*.

Imagine picking a partner to date - everyone has different criteria in what they look for in a person.  For some,  *Religion* is a deal-breaker - they could be super hot, smart, funny, nice, but if they aren't the same *Religion* as you, it isn't going to happen.  In that case you can have every box checked but one, and that one box is so important or has so much *weight* it determines your choice.

For others there aren't deal-breakers but rather different things that matter more than others.  Many people will look past the lack of intelligence, job, even personality if the person is extremely attractive.  In that case, *Looks* are *weighted* more than other factors.

The stronger the *weight* a variable has, the more other variables need to compensate in the absence of that variable.

Everybody on the same page with the idea of *weighting?* I hope so.

In trading and in the Wiki specifically you are told that there are various things you need to look for in order to take a trader (for the purposes of this, let's assume it is a Bullish trade).

A strong daily chart is important, with a clear upward trend through various Resistance levels.

Corresponding Market Direction and Daily Market Chart

Relative Strength on the 5-Minute and Daily Chart

Good Volume

Etc.

All of these things blend together to tell a story about the stock. Sometimes that story has external news associated with it, sometimes not, but generally if you look at the whole context you can get a sense of what Institutions are thinking.

What seems to have happened is the some of you have taken to this to mean that unless every box is checked, or unless the **major** boxes (like a strong daily chart) is checked, one should not take the trade.  In this sense you are not weighting the variable but instead you are either making all of them "deal-breakers" or over-weighting a few of them to essentially make them "deal-breakers".

That is not how it works - if you do not have a strong daily chart, then you need to make sure there are other boxes checked that make up for the loss of that weighted variable.

Now let's look at $MRNA again - shitty D1:

There is no doubt that daily chart is bearish and ugly - but look closer and you will see four bounces off support now and a clear mental stop at $99.  You will also see the upside to this trade, which showed high Relative Volume and Relative Strength on 8/9.  So now I have a stock already past the shock of earnings, resting on a three-year long Algo line, building up support, with huge upside and limited downside.    All of those variables combine are enough to overcome the crappy daily chart.

In fact, what this shows is that the daily chart is **so important** that you really need a large combination of factors to overcome its absence.

Part of the issue is that traders that are learning **love checkboxes** \- if they can automate it, even better - but as noted (in the Wiki), it doesn't work like that.  Each variable has different *weights* and those weights change dependent on the situation and market environment.  What might be important in a Bearish trend is not as noteworthy in a Bullish one (for example).

I get the desire for things to be neat and replicable - if that was the case then it would not take so long to master this profession.  But it does, it takes time, it takes years...and there simply is no way around that.

Break out of the mindset that things can fit into a neat set of boxes - each trade is a story.  You may not always read it correctly, but you need to be learning how put the pieces together to see what it is trying to tell you and not every piece is of equal importance.

Best, H.S.
