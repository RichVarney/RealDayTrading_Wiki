Every trading day you can be presented with 20 or more *quality* set-ups.  Hell, if you look hard enough you can even find quality set-ups on days when SPY is putting everyone into a coma by chopping around in a narrow range.

*What is a quality set-up?*  

Glad you asked.  A quality set-up is one that ticks off most if not all of your "check-boxes".  You do have check-boxes, right?  *If not, stop reading and get yourself some damn check-boxes.*  Seriously, everyone needs check-boxes, at least mental ones.

Now, if you follow the method taught in this sub (and if you don't, you should - read the Wiki I hear it has a memorizing affect on people) your checkboxes would include stocks that have; *Relative Strength/Weakness*, good *Daily Charts,* a *market tailwind*, *volume*, etc., etc.  You've heard it all before.

Now, we also know that if one ***only*** took the 2 or 3 *best* set-ups each day, especially for those under-the oppressive account screwing PDT restriction, it would result in a significantly higher win-rate and profit-factor.  

The problem of course is - *which ones should you take?*   

Well there is a simple way to see how well you are able to judge the difference between a *good trade* and a *great trade.*  Or, more importantly, if some of the trades you felt were *good* but are actually *really fucking terrible*. 

**Don't take them - Rank them**

Sort of a *Hot or Not* for trades (does anyone remember that site? I am sure it left quite a few people scarred for life).  

A simple system - 1 thru 5.  

*With 1 being a trade that looks good, all the way to 5 which is one of those trades you chase to get in and don't want to miss.*

For each trade you find, simply write it down in a spreadsheet, or well, anywhere really, like this:

**10:20am Long AAPL, 165 Strike Call, Expires 4/14, for $2.75 - Rank: 2**

A pretty simple format, yes?

Now there are two ways you can go about this - 

1) At the end of each day look at all the trades and decide if you would keep it or close it.  If you would close it then enter in the *Profit* or *Loss* next to the Ranking.  If you would keep it, do the same thing at the end of the following day and so on, until you close it.

or, more accurately

2) Make the trade in a Paper Account and manage it based on your real accounts restrictions.  If you have a margin based PDT-restricted account then you only have 3 Day Trades to use - if you have a Cash Account (don't get me started) then keep track of how much you have to spend, etc.  If you are over $25K then Day Trade it how you normally would.

After about 100 or so trades (remember you should be able to find 20 or more good set-ups a day, and if you can't, you need to Read the Damn Wiki!), the assignment is easy - group all the trades according to their rank.  You should have a bunch of trades that are ranked 1 and less trades ranked 5.  Then just calculate the average profit (or loss) percentage per trade.  So if you spent $275 on getting that AAPL call (there is no point in getting more than 1 Contract or more than 1 Share), and the profit was $550, then you made 200%.  Just take the average for each group.

*The results should be linear*.  If the trades you ranked #1 have an average profit of 35% and those you ranked 5 average a loss of -42% then you have an issue in picking good trades.  The trades you think are just "ok" are actually really good, and the ones you think are great are clearly shit.  

At that point you need analyze why you are over-valuing some trades and under-valuing others.  Perhaps you are drawn to stocks that have sudden burst in volume/price due to news-driven events, so you give them a higher ranking, but they tend to turn against you.  Or maybe you under-value slower but more stress-free trades that just grind up.

The goal is to get the results to a nice linear step up in profit with each ranking.  

This exercise (and there are various ways to do it once you get the point) will help you fine-tune your *radar* as all the rules and methods in the world won't help if you just suck at telling the difference between a decent set-up and a great one.
