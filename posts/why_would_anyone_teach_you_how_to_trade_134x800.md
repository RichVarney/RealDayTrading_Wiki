I am going to be brutally honest. Unless someone has a vested interest in your success, they are not going to personally mentor you.

You can’t afford a great trader. Every minute a great trader spends with you is a lost opportunity for them. Realize that the people who are charging $2000+ for a weekend session at the Holiday Inn are not the “real deal”. A great trader doesn’t need your $2000. These supposed “gurus” are fleecing you for something you can read in a book and you are not going to learn much in the course of a weekend. The same is true for online courses. “Prop shops” will teach you the basics and impose a bunch of rules on your trading. Their goal is to keep you in the game so that they can charge you commissions for as long as possible. They only care about your success to the extent that they will have to fill your seat when you blow out.

When a great trader teaches hundreds of traders, he gives his edge away and now he has to compete with you and every other trader he’s taught (and anyone you might teach). It makes no sense for him to divulge his secrets and to share that wealth.

It’s difficult to complete the trading journey and to summit. It is mentally exhausting and a mentor has to relive the trials and tribulations. The constant questions wear you down. They are rehashed over and over again and some of them are ridiculous. The mentor pours his soul into it and ultimately the trader fails anyway. Given what he can make trading, it’s just not worth it.

Even at the level of this sub, I only answer well-conceived questions where I know the person has put the effort into reading the WIKI.

I don't want to taint this article. This is self-promotional and you can click here to find out [why I do it](https://oneoption.com/general/heres-what-motivates-me/).

During Covid-19, Hari discovered OneOption. He has incredible trading skills. He learned the system very quickly. This decision making process provided him with an edge and he took his trading to new heights. In 30 years I have not seen anyone with his trading skills and generosity. He makes hundreds of thousands of dollars in a day. Why would someone like Hari want to mentor you when it might cost him his next great trade? Why would any trader of that caliber waste their time on you? Hari posts all of his trade logs with detail, he writes articles and he does live Twitter events. Stick very close to him, he is one of a kind.

This is a rare community and it is the only one I post to. I appreciate the culture Hari has created and the fact that you are all helping each other out. When I see this collaboration, it motivates me to contribute.

My parting message is this; don’t trust anyone who wants to charge you money to teach you how to trade. They just want to fleece you for something you can read in a book. This journey is one that you have to complete yourself. The real skills come from experience. You will learn a lot about yourself on this journey and you have to live it (not just read about it). Great traders keep to themselves, they do not teach classes. They make more money trading than you could ever pay them. They fiercely protect their secrets and they work that edge as long as they can. If a large institution discovers it, they will exploit it until it is gone.

Society has bred a sense of entitlement. I owe you nothing. However, if I see you pouring your heart and soul into this and ask intelligent questions that tell me you’ve read the WIKI, I will try to help.

This system is the base of the pyramid. Even after you master it, the learning will never end. Your success will depend on your effort, creativity and discipline as you complete the top of the pyramid and make it your own.
