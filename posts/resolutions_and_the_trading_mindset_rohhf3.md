I type this with my fingers covered in bandages....and why? Because in order to put together toys meant for 2-3 year old kids, it seems you also need to have hands the size of a 2-3 year old as well!  I feel like a bunch of Oompa Loompas are going to pop out, and start singing about how this is what I get for spoiling my kids. 

Anyway - on to my New Years Resolution - it is this - ***nothing***.  I do not make them.  They never work and never will.  But they do provide an important lesson for trading.  And I am not going to pass up the opportunity to impart a lesson in trading - especially not on Christmas!

First one needs to understand why New Years Resolutions do not work. It is the same reason *diets* almost always wind up failing.  

*You can't change your behavior unless your change the reasons behind it.* 

You can resolve to be better with your money in 2022 - but if you don't address the cause for your lack of financial discipline, it won't matter, you will just revert back to your old carefree ways.  Make pledges to lose weight, be healthier and go to the gym all you want, but there is a reason you are out-of-shape to begin with and a simple pledge isn't going to fix it.  

A desire to change is certainly admirable, but in the end, these pledges are more about being able to tell yourself that you are *trying* to change, without every really *having* to change. 

So what does this have to do with trading?

Many of the posts in the Wiki (yes, read the Wiki if you haven't!) speaks to how important *mindset* is in being a successful trader. 

If you lack confidence in your trading, you aren't going to fix that just by saying, "I am going to be a more confident trader in 2022!", and if you take too many risks, simply declaring, "I will not YOLO in 2022" isn't going to solve your problem.  There are underlying reasons why you aren't confident or why you have a tendency towards gambling.  Resolutions don't make those reasons go away, it just signals that you *wish* they would.  

No post on Reddit is going to solve anyone's psychological issues, and this one is not an exception to that rule.  Only the process of identifying the root cause and then systematically eliminating it through action can do that.  But pledging to change a behavior without first identifying the cause behind it, is like putting the proverbial cart before the horse. 

I'll give a personal example - when I was younger (I am talking elementary school here), I was socially inept. I felt I was smarter than the other kids and it showed - you probably never met a more intellectually stuck-up 3rd grader in your life.  But walking around thinking and acting like every other kid was a fucking moron did not do much for my social skills - not that I wanted to be invited to their stupid Bowling Alley parties anyway - I mean, what is the point if you are just going to put bumpers on the lanes??  Sorry Tyler, you didn't get a "strike", you just bounced the damn ball off the sides - it should be a gutter - you get a 0 Tyler! (you can see why they didn't want to invite me).   I was the little asshole in 1st grade telling all the kids that Santa wasn't real.  Yeah - *that kid*.  

But as I grew older it became apparent to me that it would be difficult to be successful unless one could navigate social situations.  I knew the issue - I hated them.  But I also knew the value of being good at social interaction and it was clear that one could not be successful without the skill.  So I spent years watching kids that were popular (creepy, I know) - how they acted, what they did, what they talked about it.  Soon I began to notice something - *they were all alike*.  It didn't matter what age they were, young or adult - *socially successful people all shared similar traits*.  And I noticed something else - other people responded to those traits in a very predictable fashion.  Socially successful people seemed to know this, if not consciously than intuitively.  I found that by integrating those traits into my behavior, I could excel in any social situation.  So that is what I did.  I can now work the room at a party in Bel Air as easily as I can a tailgate party in the parking lot of a football stadium or a BBQ in a trailer park.  I still don't like it, and would rather be home, but the point is *I can* if needed, and many times it was *very needed*.  

I didn't just say to myself, "I am going to get better at being social" - I identified why I wasn't, found the right solution, and implemented it.  It would have been easier to simply say, "I am an introvert" or "I lack confidence and so I am shy" - but that wouldn't have been cause.  Without knowing the cause, I couldn't figure out the solution.  And now Tyler can go to hell, *he isn't invited to* ***my*** *party*, the little shit.

From what I have seen, many of you have issues of confidence, issues of impulsiveness or even problems with immaturity, and those issues are clearly obstacles to becoming a more successful trader. Each of them have causes, some of which may run very deep psychologically.  So my advice to you is - don't waste another year promising yourself that you are going to "change", instead - use the year to actually figure out why you are that way to begin with, so you can truly move forward.

I also want to note that there are some issues that are outside a persons control.  Some of you may feel quite alone during the holidays, and as a result - very depressed.  I know this community isn't a substitute for real-life companionship - but also know that you do have a large group of people here *that will support you*.  So please, if you are feeling down this holiday season, reach out to one another - I believe you will find there are many others that feel the same way you do.  

We are of course here to learn a life skill, and become financial independent, but along the way we need to help each other in that journey.  And if you see someone that needs help, but may not be the type to *ask for it -* take the first step and reach out to them.  If only to just let them know that you are there if they need someone.

Anyway, today's *life lesson* has been brought to you by the spirit of Christmas :)

Best, H.S.
