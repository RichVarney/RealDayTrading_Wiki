Happy New Year Traders!

I hope your trading is off to a good start this year. I've been playing "mad scientist" for the last month so I have not been able to post. My quest to automate trendlines started 10 years ago. For every two points on a chart, there is a trendline. There are thousands of them and the hard part is finding the good ones. If the trendline breach is not reliable, there is no reason to search for it. My goal has always been to identify the best ones so that we can search for them. We can only draw so many alert lines and we miss some of the great ones.

Trendlines are the most common form of technical analysis and all it takes is a pencil. That makes them relevant. I plan on writing future articles on trendlines so let's cover some basics.

Let's start with a few terms I use. Trendlines can either connect **highs** or **lows** and they are either ascending **(+)** or descending **(-)**. That means we have **High-**, **High+**, **Low+** and **Low-** trendlines. High+ and High- breaches produce **breakouts** (bullish), and Low+ and Low- trendlines produce **breakdowns** (bearish). These terms allow us to efficiently reference them in the chat room and we can instantly visualize  them without even looking at a chart.

Contra trendlines (**High-** and **Low+**) search for trend reversals and they are going "against the grain". They are on a constant collision course with price and that makes them very common. When they produce steep angles that are greater than 45 degrees we have to be extremely careful. The trend is strong and we want to join it, not fade it. Shallow long term angles that are less than 45 degrees indicate the the trend is tired. It is losing its power and it could be ready to reverse.

**High-**

These trendlines connect the “highs” and the trendline slopes downward (descending). When that trendline is broken it will often signal that a trend reversal is likely. Breakouts above the trendline are “contra” to the prevailing trend. If the breakout was just a little “dead cat” bounce and the stock continues lower we would call that a “**High- Fake**” when the stock drops back below the trendline.

**Low+**

These trendlines connect the “lows” and the trendline slopes upwards (ascending). When the trendline is broken it will often signal that a trend reversal is likely. Breakouts below the trendline are “contra” to the prevailing trend. If the stock breaches the trendline on a little profit taking and then resumes the uptrend, we call it a “**Low+ Fake**” when it gets back above the trendline.

Continuation trendlines (**High+** and **Low-**) trendlines search for opportunities to join the trend. The train has left the station and these trendlines are waiting for a pause or a dip so that they can climb aboard.

**High+**

These trendlines connect the “highs” and the trendline slopes upwards (ascending). They are less common than a **High-** because they are chasing after an uptrend. When the highs are connected, the line is often moving away from price, not towards it like **High-**. In general, these upside breakouts tend to be a little less reliable because the breaches often happen near the end of the move (buying climax). For that reason, we want to watch for “**High+ Tops**” as a possible sign of a top and a trend reversal.

**Low-**

These trendlines connect the “lows” and the trendline slopes downwards (descending). They are less common than a **Low+** because they are chasing after an downtrend. When the lows are connected, the line is often moving away from price, not towards it like **Low+**. In general, these downside breakouts tend to be a little less reliable because the breaches often happen near the end of the move (selling climax). For that reason, we want to watch for failed breakdowns as a possible sign of a trend reversal. If the stock breaksdown and then crosses back above the trendline we call this a “**Low- Bottom**“.

Now that we have covered the terms I can write some trendline articles and teach you some high probability patterns. I think I will write one now.

Trade well.
