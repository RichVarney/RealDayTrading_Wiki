I thought that as we prepare to enter a new year of trading i would share my results for trading the highest probability trade setups. It should be noted that 2022 was a bear market and the most difficult trading environment i have experienced in my 13+ years of trading. It was very important to have and use detailed criteria for taking trades or the results could be financially devastating. I know many many traders that had to call it quits in 2022, and in most cases it was because they failed to recognize the market we were in, failed to adjust their strategies and did not tighten up their criteria to only the highest probability trades. Some years the market is forgiving and they can survive, not 2022. Make 2023 a year to be patient, trade only the best and work on your mindset, that Hari has so eloquently laid out.

I have posted before on finding and trading the highest probability trade setups. It takes patience and focus to ignore the distractions of dozens of other trades being posted, FOMO, chasing momentum moves, magic indicators and on and on. It is critical that you have criteria for finding the highest probability trade setups and stick to them since you will bombarded with distractions all the time. I have fine tuned my highest probability trades setups since my last post and i will include a video i did on the process i follow and a link to the trades i took from dec01 to dec23 (current month).

The basic selection process i use is as follows:

Daily chart and 5 min chart of stock you are trading should align

Trade in the direction of the market if there is one, both the 5 min market trend and the daily market trend need to be considered, for intraday trades only the 5 min market trend is paramount, for any trade that may be a swing the daily trend must also be considered. If no market trend both long and short trades can be taken following the rest of the criteria.

Trade in the direction of the stock trend, no counter trend trading.

Only trade stocks that have institutional involvement driving them (I use Compass System for this, explained in the video)

Enter longs near a support level and enter shorts near a resistance level. These levels can be a break of compression, (i use dynamic compression identified by the Compass software as well as standard compression breaks), a bounce and confirmation off the VWAP or moving average that the price is following closely, a break of an algo support or resistance line from your daily chart. There are others but the critical point is to enter as close to support or resistance as possible.

A Heiken Ashe reversal candle for your entry increases the probability of success

Trade stocks with relative strength or relative weakness to the market, those will be the most forgiving.

HAVE PATIENCE    this is the most difficult criteria

We are looking to Trade the Best and  Skip the Rest       Skipping less than the highest probability stocks is critical, eliminating losers is more important than getting winners

&#x200B;

So to recap the criteria

**Daily chart and 5 min chart must align**

**Trade with the market direction**

**Trade with the stock direction**

**Only take trades that institutions are driving**

**Trade stocks with relative strength or weakness**

**Buy at Support and sell at Resistance**

**Have Patience**

**The stats for these trades from Oct 1 thru Dec 23** 

Total trades 331

wins 304             91.8%   

losses  19            5.7%

scratch   8           2.4%

Profit Factor    13.4

Below are the trades from 12-1 to 12-23 using the highest probability trades setups

Trades were all calls, puts and debit spreads (a few stock).

Here is a link to a video i did on finding these highest probability trade setups using the criteria outlined and the Compass Software i use. (have also incorporated a new market internals software as well). It will ask for you e-mail address, i couldnt get around that but i post this just for educational purposes.

Best of luck in 2023!
