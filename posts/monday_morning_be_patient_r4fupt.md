The S&P futures market opens in about an hour and will give a pretty good indication if the selling pressure has abated or plans to continue.

Key here is *patience.  Buyer and Sellers are both going to be looking for signs of a definitive direction before committing.*  

This means that gaps up can be reversed and gaps down could potentially look to tested the SMA 50 (if that is breached in a meaningful way - ***look out below***).  

The temptation might be to rush in and go long **MRNA** or short the market.  If we gap up you might want to jump in and go long **NVDA** or **AAPL**.

Wait.  

Yes, you may miss a big move.  But this is a dangerous environment right now, one that will be filled with both *bull* and *bear* traps.  Do not find yourself getting caught in one.  

***There will be plenty of opportunities throughout the day - your best bet is to wait for at least thirty minutes before making a play. Do not let FOMO drive your trading!***

I will be watching the S&P futures market and will give my thoughts if I see anything noteworthy.  

Otherwise - I will see you on the battlefield tomorrow morning!

Best, H.S.
