One of the great things about *Short-term Trading* is that every day is different.  Some days are *bullish,* some are *bearish* and some don't know what the hell they are - but we trade what's in front of us.

As some of you may remember from my previous posts, one of my areas of specialty in Social Science/Statistics was that of Taxonomy - which is the science of categorization.  If you properly categorize things, whether it is people, situations, ideas, etc...you can better understand and respond to them. 

Given that, we can categorize each trading day into one of the following:

***Bullish Trend*** \- this is pretty much everyone's favorite type of market.  Whether it *gapped up* and continued to go, or just stacked green candles in an orderly climb throughout the day you can be fairly confident that the trend will continue throughout the day.

***Bearish Trend***  \- fairly obvious, this is the reverse of the *Bullish Trend* days.

***Chop -***  total pain-in-the-ass market conditions that offers *low probability* trading.  The market establishes a High and Low range early on and then stays within this range.   Sometimes these are *Inside Days* meaning the range on **SPY** is *within* the range of the previous day and sometimes they are outside the previous day, but still contained (this tends to happen when you *gap up/down* and then start to *Chop*).

***Dangerous Chop*** \- this is a tag of my own creation and to me represents the worst possible trading day - this is a day that has all the characteristics of *Chop*, but due to high volume or high volatility (e.g. Economic numbers about to be released, Fed speaking, etc.) there is a constant danger that **SPY** can break out of that range at any time.  

There are other potential categories, but those are the primary ones.  

Here is an visual representation of the past few days:

As you can see, even though there is some well-defined zones for **SPY**, several times it looked to break out of those areas, on both sides.  Those attempts to break-through, for me, would put this into the category of *Dangerous Chop.*

So - how does this help you?

Well, the first question you might be asking is - "Like so many other things, those zones are clear in hindsight, but how do you recognize them while they are occurring?"  

And **that** is a damn good question.  

You initially have to realize that you are in fact in - *Chop*.  That is easy enough, the damn thing goes up, and then it reverses, and then reverses again. Shorts look good, then Longs look good, and then nothing looks good.  Chop is easy enough to know when you are in it.  *Bullish/Bearish* Trend days have a distinct lack of stress with them (unless you are still being idiotic by trying to counter-trend trade, in which case you need to seriously stop and just read the damn Wiki), whereas *Chop* days rarely have a *stress-free* trade.  

Once you ascertain that you are in fact in, Chop - it is just a matter of looking back on the 5-minute chart to see where the High and Low is - draw your lines across the top and bottom.  The longer the lines, the more established the zone becomes.  

See? Easy.

Ok - after you identify the type of market you are in - that become your *thesis* for the trading day.  That thesis then impacts how you should trade.  Here are some examples:

**Example A:** You go long on a stock at $50, it is a clear *Bullish Trend Day*.  After moving up to $50.15, the market pulls back and so does your stock - it drops to $49.55, even losing its' *Relative Strength* in the process.  However, you can be confident, based on your *thesis,* that **SPY** will resume its' upward climb and so will your stock, so you hold the trade.

**Example B:** Same stock, and you go long at $50, but it is a *Chop Day* \- however, this stock has really good *Relative Strength* and the market is currently moving up.  Still, after you enter the trade the market reverses and the stock drops to $49.55.  In this scenario you have two options: **1)** hold the position knowing that eventually SPY will come back up to the higher end of the range again, or **2)** cut the position because the stock may not recover its' *Relative Strength* and even if **SPY** does come back up, the stock may not recover enough to be profitable.   ***Unless there are really compelling reasons to hold the position, you should generally choose the second option.***

**Example C:**  Yes, same shitty stock, same damn price at $50 - same trade, and of course the same thing happens - it drops to $49.55, the market drops, and it loses its' *Relative Strength*, except now you are in a *Dangerous Chop* day.  In this case, you get the hell out of the trade.  

*Obviously the prices here are arbitrary for the sake of an example, and your stop of the trade might have been at $49.25 or $48.30, but in this illustration a drop of .35 cents is enough to make you consider exiting the trade.*

Your decision on whether or not to exit the trade depends on how you have categorized the market and how confident you are in that *thesis*.  

As a further example of this - I classify the last two days as being in *Dangerous Chop,* and you can see from my trades posted that I gave the trades I was in very little wiggle room.  I cut many trades quickly the moment they turned against me, and took profits just as quick.  Rarely did I let a trade run for more than 10-minutes and only once did I add to my winning position. 

Much like your overall view of the market impacts whether or not you have enough comfort to swing any positions, the same applies to your intraday view as well.   

It is also worthwhile to identify days with these tags in your trading journal and look at your corresponding stats.  On days that you classify as being *Chop* or *Dangerous Chop* I would suggest that win-rate matters less and profit factor should be the main calculation you look at.  On days with *Chop* it is ok to have a higher number of losses, because you are exiting trades much quicker than normal.  This requires a very different mindset as it can be difficult to rack up several losses in a row, even though they might be small losses.

However, on days that are *Trend Days* I strongly suggest you practice *Averaging Up*.  Adding to winners is one of the single most important skills a trader can learn, and definitely one of the most profitable. Still, it is mentally very difficult to add money into a trade at a point where you would normally close it and take profits.  Particularly since one of the reasons you are taking profits is because you feel (or are afraid) that the position will reverse on you. To help overcome that mindset, try this exercise ***on trend days***:

Use 1/4th of your usual position size to open up your next trade - so if you normally buy 100 shares of a $100 stock, this time buy 25 shares instead.  Then establish two clear benchmarks - these benchmarks should be based on the price action, the market, the stock, etc.  Make the first benchmark the halfway point from where you normally would have taken profits - let's say in this example it is at $100.25, at this point you will double your position size to 50.  Then the next benchmark should be where you would normally have taken profits which in this case would be $100.50 - here you will double your position again - to 100 shares.  Now you are at your normal position size but you have *averaged up* into that position.  At this point set a reasonable profit target (which can be just adding the first benchmark - which in this example was .25 - so, $100.75).

The goal of this exercise is to rewire your mindset to get used to *adding* to your winners.  Eventually you will be able to open the position with your normal size (100), and then add from there - but until then, use this exercise to practice seeing doing this impacts your overall results.  

Every day is different but as long as you are able to identify which day you are in, you can trade accordingly.

 

Best, H.S.
