I have posted a lot about trading only the highest probability trade setups. I will outline exactly what those trade setups are and my recent results trading only those setups.

The highest probability trade setups consistent of these criteria:

Price breaking out of a dynamic compression zone (the zone is created by my software) Breakout to the upside for longs and downside for shorts

Breakout includes a Heiken Ashe (HA) reversal candle 

Stock is breaking out in the direction of its current trend (no counter trend trades)

Trade in the direction of the market trend (if there is one) if not lean on the stock trend

Only take trades that have institutional involvement in the trade  (again, defined by my software)

Only take stocks with relative strength or weakness versus the SPY or QQQ

On order to be able to hold through some pull backs the Daily Chart needs to align with the 5 Min Chart 

**The final point is to have patience.** Remember our objective is not to trade but to make money, trades are just the vehicle to make  profits 

I have listed my last 44 trades that had a record of 41 wins 1 loss and 2 scratches. My overall win rate on these highest probability only trades setups is around 92%  this year.  Patience is well rewarded and trades with this high win rate can be done using larger size.
