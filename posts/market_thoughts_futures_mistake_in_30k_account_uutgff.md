On Friday the market closed on the heels of a significant Bullish reversal.  A $7 shift in 45 minutes took SPY from Bear market territory to finishing the day in the green. This violent reversal left many traders wondering - ***Why?***.  It certainly caught me off guard (although in hindsight it shouldn’t have, but hindsight is 20/20, etc. etc.) as I had an S&P Futures Short on at the time.

It’s always an interesting educational exercise to theorize about the “what” and “why” on the market (i.e. price action on SPY).  Although, as I’m sure many of you experienced, the farther down the rabbit hole you go, the more you find a counter hypothesis for every one of your theories.  

So there I was, using the $30K account with an hour left to go in the trading week and the account stood at $38,400 (here is the log: [https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021](https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021) ).  That’s an $8,400 in 7 trading days - a 28% increase.   On that pace I was about 9 days away from hitting the $50K starting point for the Trade for a Living Challenge (probably even less as the bigger the account gets the easier it is to make a higher return).

My win rate was over 83% and Profit Factor close to 3.

In other words - everything was going perfectly.  And then I made a mistake, an error in *Situational Awareness*.

But first let’s go back to the market and consider what we know as an absolutes: 

***Did anything change on the macro economic front? No.***  

The same conditions apply.  So that leaves the following - 

**1)** we briefly hit the price level that is considered a “bear” market - a somewhat arbitrary but psychologically meaningful level, and then bounced shortly afterwards, 

**2)** short covering bounces are not uncommon after significant drops.

Couple those thoughts with the expectation of high volatility, which by definition means violent (of varying degrees) reversals.   Also add in the expectation for a capitulation low required before any meaningful recovery.

All combined that tells you that this is not a good swing environment and you should consider any reversals temporary unless either the macro conditions shift, or the market capitulates

In the end those two conclusions are what impacts your trading as a, “thesis”

Ok, now back to my "screw up" - and I will have them, in fact you will probably learn more from the mistakes I make than the wins - although I do not intend to make them regularly.   Btw, any person calling themselves a *Professional Trader* that does not ever admit to mistakes or show them, is full of shit.  Someone that is only showing you their successes is either trying to sell you on something or feed their ego.   And while there is no doubt I have an ego, I absolutely despise false representation.  If you have to feed your ego by being fake, well that is pathetic.

So - why the hell did I hold that /ES Short, turning it into a $4,000 mistake?  As I said - Situational Awareness, but not on the Market, on myself.  Anyone that has watched me trade S&P futures knows that I have been fine with rather large drawdowns on the position.  If your market thesis is correct it usually only a matter of time before your futures position becomes profitable, and those times where your thesis is incorrect there should be very clear signals that trigger an exit.

Except that is true when you have an account of large enough size to hold that position and then continue trading without so much of a dent to your buying power. But that is not the case with a $30K account - the margin requirement for 2 /ES Contracts is roughly $31,000 - which means that holding the position over the weekend not only risked a further drawdown, but it also meant starting Monday with reduced BP that would not be restored until the following day.

But my mind was not in that place, my mind was in the place of, "this bounce is temporary and should reverse either in the last ten minutes or on Monday morning" just like it would be if I had been trading my regular sized account. By the time I realize my mistake it was too late.  I debated holding the Short over the weekend anyway, as I felt, and still feel that we were seeing a short-covering bounce off Bear Market levels, one that will be temporary in nature.  But in the end, the Buying Power issue settled it for me and I closed the Short for a loss.

So this is where no having **situational awareness** knocked out half of my gains.  

Yes, I am still up over $4,000 in just 7 Days which is well ahead of the pace that would be set for even the $50K account, but still it stings.  It was a preventable error and self-inflicted wound.  I can not trade S&P Futures in the $30K account the same way I do in the larger one - which means those trades need a much tighter leash on them.

Anyway, I thought I would share my self-reflection on the error.

 

Best, H.S.
