Look I get it - you have successful traders posting trades in *real time* \- you see the track record, and you want some winning trades yourself - so you follow the trade posted.

Makes total sense, and many of you do it.  However, many of you also get burned doing this and here is why - 

**1)** To begin with you don't know the reason that trader is making the trade.  For example, perhaps I shorted **AMZN** or **GOOGL**, but the reason I did that is because the rest of my swing trades were all bullish and one bearish **AMZN** trade is enough to hedge an entire bullish portfolio.  As a *hedge* I am actually hoping it *isn't* needed and it loses money.   Or I might be executing that trade to just balance out my holdings, so it isn't a *hedge* but it also doesn't have the same conviction behind it as other trades might.

**2)** Different account size - I might do a $6 Option Lotto trade - and on Lotto trades they tend to be all or nothing - they either work or they go to $0.  And you follow that Lotto.  However, I have close to $2 million in Buying Power in my account, so if a $7 Option goes to $0 it is fine - hell, if 20 of them go to $0 it is still fine.  This happened today - I had 20 **SNOW** Puts, and lost $14,000 - but I made over $35,000 on **LCID.**  I don't like giving out numbers like that, but it is needed to make this point. At the end of the day I look at *all* my Lottos combined and see if they made money - in other words, *was the strategy profitable*.  I sized the Lottos so a .23 cent to .69 win on **LCID** is more than enough to make up for $7 to $0 loss on **SNOW**.  

**3)** You don't know the exit plan of the person trading, and they are not going to stop and spell it out.  Why? Because *they are trading, it is their job*.  Maybe you went long in **ISIG** at $24.50 following someone into the trade - now they might be good all the way down to $20.50 which is where the upward sloping trendline crosses - but that is a $4 loss, are you sized for a $4 loss? Probably not, since you did not know that $20.50 would be the mental stop. And once again, traders are not going to go through the whole *Long ISIG $24.50 with a mental stop around $20.50 because the upward sloping trendline from the 12/27 candle connects there and it has offered support on the 1/4 - 1/5 - 1/6 and today, so I will exit the trade if that support is broken* ***and*** *there are consecutive candles staying below that price.*  No - they are just going to say Long ISIG $24.50.  And then the exact same trader may make that trade again, but this time looking for a fast move and if they don't get it they will exit almost immediately - once again, you don't know that.  

**4)** Let's face it - when people ask, "*Are you still in XYZ?"* what they are really saying is, *"I followed you into XYZ and now it is down, so I am freaking out and hoping you can offer some reassurance!"*  .  Let me say this again, as I have said it many times in the past - ***traders hate being followed into trades, hate feeling responsible for those trades, and especially hate that other traders are now depending on them for their exit strategy****.*  And that is the issue - you are *relying* on someone else for an exit - not thinking it up yourself.  So what happens if I enter **ISIG** and it hits my profit target, so I sell - but shit I knocked over my coffee, so I quickly grab paper towels, clean it up, and I get a bunch of texts (this all actually happened this week by the way) - and I wind up posting the exit about 5 minutes after I completed the trade - well on a stock like **ISIG** that is like an eternity - and now you are seeing the exit too late.

You *should* be learning from trades that are posted, examining them and trying to understand how they found the stock, why they chose the type of trade they did, and what made them exit, *and then* after-hours if you still have questions you ask the trader about it.  

But if you *do* follow someone into a trade (hell, I followed u/onewyse into several trades this week) - ***it is your own trade - not theirs - so you need to figure out your exit and strategy.  You need to make the trade as if you found it yourself, and rely on yourself to manage the trade.***

***If everyone followed this you would have a much better trading experience.***

Best, H.S.
