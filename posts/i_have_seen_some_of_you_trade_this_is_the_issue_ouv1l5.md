So I have seen some of you trade this past week in the live chat where I am posting for the $30K challenge.  The issue I witnessed is so similar to the issues I have seen plague most new traders that I have to assume it is prevalent throughout this community.  The best way to illustrate this is by an example:

You go long Stock XYZ at $100 - the stock is up $1.75 on the day and the high of the day was $100.30, it looks strong and seems to be through its' major SMA's on the daily chart.  Great, nice pick

After bouncing up to $100.15, it drops quickly down to $99.95.    The market is also dropping at this point, but you stick with it, VWAP is at $99.30.  

Ten minutes later it is now at $99.85 and you are watching it like a hawk.  Only down 15 cents, but as usual you bought way too many shares, maybe 500? maybe 1,000? maybe more.

Suddenly it is at $99.75 and now you have your finger on the sell button.  You don't want to get trapped in another losing trade.  

It starts to consolidate here, but it is really not moving. You are watching other trades pass you by because all of your buying power is now tied up in this stock.  You consider averaging down and are proud of yourself that you did not.

$99.65 now and some indicator crossed below another indicator and you are down 35 cents.   So you bail.  That's it, you aren't going to sit around and wait for this thing to tank. 

Twenty minutes later Stock XYZ hits a new high of day at $100.50, and you kick yourself. Repeatedly.

Sound familiar?  

Here's the thing - you are **never** going to get the exact right entry and time for a trade.  It is always going to be rare that you enter a stock and it immediately goes your way without once looking back.  

Stocks move around, a lot.  They check the bid, they consolidate, and there can be a lot of senseless chop.  When you take a trade you aren't trying to get it right that **exact** moment.  You are analyzing the overall trend of the stock, the direction of it and the direction of the market.

Unless there is a significant technical violation (i.e. breaks VWAP ***and*** stays below it), your thesis should remain intact.  

It is your mindset that is killing the trade, not your analysis.  You **cannot** trade emotionally.  You **cannot** trade with so much money in a position that you are on the edge of your seat watching it.  If you do *I absolutely guarantee you will fail.*

Until this issue is under control, all the knowledge in the world won't help you.  So whether you need to read **Trading in the Zone** by Mark Douglas, talk to your shrink, or go to a zen place - this should be your number one priority.
