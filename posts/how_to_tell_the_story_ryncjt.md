I have been saying that reading the charts is like reading a story - a story of Institutional buying and selling.  Not exactly a page turner, but at least there are pictures!

Let's look at **MSFT:**

Since late November **MSFT** has been trying to establish a new all-time high, and each time Institutions clearly said, "I am not going above $345 for this damn stock no matter what..."  I also see on each of those dates volume was strong - so right off the bat I know that unless **MSFT** has some sort of event (news, earnings, etc.) it is going to be really difficult to get Institutions interested in driving the price above that level.

I also see that right after the third attempt (which at that point seemed kind of thirsty to me), Institutions started unloading the stock a bit.  And why not, if there is a natural cap at $345, and the stock is right around $345, what the hell am I holding it for, right?  

So down it tumbles, right through the SMA50, and then it continues falling until it hits the SMA100 - finally closing on its' low of the day.  At this point, one wonders if buyers would re-engage - I mean you sold it around $340 and now it is $315....not a bad deal.  But nope, the next day it gapped down below the SMA100 - but then it ran **smack into the upward trend algo line** \- And for two days pretty much formed two *doji* candles, with very high volume.  

High volume days where the price barely moves tells you that buyers and sellers are faced-off.  Here you have a bunch of algos kicking in, it sees the line, the line is hit, that algo is gonna buy the damn line. But you also have sellers because this stock just dropped through two SMA's and they don't want to get trapped on a day it decides to visit the lonely SMA 200 - that would suck for them.

Speaking of trapped - that is where the stock is now - trapped, between the *Algo line* as support and the SMA100 as resistance. Between $312.75 and $316 is where the stock lives.

So what do you do?  If you are short, you get out of the short, because this thing might just bounce.  If you are long, well if you are long then you aren't too bright and it doesn't matter what you do.  

If on Monday **MSFT** opens below that line and the market is bearish - **MSFT** becomes and excellent short, as it means that sellers overwhelmed the buyers and **MSFT** is probably headed to the SMA200.  However, if it opens above the SMA100 ($316) - you don't do shit - you wait.  Not until the stock clears $325 (the downward trendline and top of the 1/5 candle) does it start to become bullish again, and even then you have the SMA50 right above it that might still provide resistance.  

In other words, **MSFT** is either a short or an ignore.

And that is the story of **MSFT**.  When you look at a chart you need to be able to see the story it is telling you and then judge the price action accordingly.  Once you know the story the issue of what is noise and what is real, the question of when to get out and when to stay in, all become much more clear - as it either fits with the story or it doesn't. 

If you don't know the story then you are looking at numbers without context, and that is always a dangerous way to reach the wrong conclusions.

Best, H.S.
