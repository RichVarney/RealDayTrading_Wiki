*This is a discussion geared to novice traders who are still learning, and not depending on trading for an income.*

#### Are you demotivated? Do you feel like your discipline has waned?

We've seen many faces come and go in the Live Chat. Many of them have probably read the wiki front to back, posted excellent trades for a month or two, and they slowly stop showing up. While I hope that they've 'made it' and they're just keeping their trades private, I do fear that many of them have simply burned out. This might be due to a frustrating lack of progress, account blow up, or they just aren't able to fit trading into their life anymore.

&#x200B;

For those that feel that they aren't making any progress, I can safely assure you that it's likely not because you're lacking in any advanced chart reading techniques. Reading more books on TA is probably not the answer. While a small part of Hari's trades are 'discretionary' with price-action largely informing his trades, most of what is being traded in the Live Chat are textbook RealDayTrading setups.

&#x200B;

As Hari said many times, it will take 2 years of hard work to do this for a living. I believe that for most of us, it would probably take longer than that -- one needs to build a thick trading journal spanning a couple of thousand trades before they can truly 'lean' on their statistics to build a trading business out of.

&#x200B;

It's easy to say that you need to stay motivated and disciplined for a few years in order to build a robust trading experience, but we are all human. There is an ebb and flow to motivation, and this is further complicated by the various obstacles of life. Naturally, trading should take a back seat when there's a big change in our life, for the better or worse (reminder: this is a discussion for novices who are not yet trading for a living).

&#x200B;

There is nothing more frustrating to a normally high achieving individual, when their 'perfect' life and routine slowly unravels, and before you know it, it seems as if you've fallen years behind your peers.

&#x200B;

#### Getting back on track with the "swap method."

This idea comes from Hari's "swap method" -- instead of dumping a position, swap it with a better position. My idea is to apply it to trading. **If you've hit a lull in your trading, swap out some parts of your trading routine with a non-trading related discipline, instead of just burning out and continue doing poorly with your trading.**

&#x200B;

The idea is to **prevent burn out** by **(a) taking a step back in your trading routine,** **(b) developing a new discipline routine outside of trading,** so that you will have accomplished something outside of trading everyday. This will complement your trading mindset and positively add to your motivation.

&#x200B;

Instead of waking up at 0630 to stare at the futures or doing other market research, I might instead **wake up at 0700 to go to the gym** (if you're lost here, decide on a goal and find your training routine by READING THE WIKI on r/fitness) and then come back at 0915 to settle in before you start to trade. It doesn't have to be physical training for you, it might be waking up to talk a morning walk, making a nice breakfast, reading a few pages of a book, or anything else that you want to do in the morning.

&#x200B;

Is 0700 too early for you, or do you have kids that you have to get ready to drop off for school? Yeah, I think many of us are in this situation. This is what I do: **wake up at 0700 to do some training, come back home and take my kid to school, go back to my office by 1100-1130, just review SPY and my alerts, and trade my alerts if both SPY and the stock agrees.**

&#x200B;

*I promise you that you will feel much better having accomplished something in the morning, even if it's not trading related.* You don't need to look at what overseas markets have done, or comb through every gap-up/down stocks -- because you're still learning how to trade. If you have a news service like TradeXchange, you will get a convenient "Morning Mashup" newsletter that feeds you this information anyway, and you can read them while you have your morning coffee, or in between sets of workouts at the gym.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This can be applied to other parts of your trading routine too.

Instead of staying up until midnight to plug in Hari's trades into an Excel sheet or reviewing his TradeSync, going through every single stock in your scanner and map out the daily S/R levels/trendlines/other notes, AND setting a couple dozen alerts, I might instead suggest cutting back, and just **review 5 trades from Hari** (pay particular attention to trades he's adding onto)**, review 5 stocks from your scanners with the BEST daily charts, set 5 quality alerts** (not useless alerts that you'll ignore anyway)**,** ***and sleep 1 hour earlier***. If that's too much work for you, do **3** of each instead, or **just set alerts**, or even **just review Hari's trades,** or **just sleep earlier** (so you can wake up earlier).

Will you miss out on some stocks? Probably. Will you be accomplishing less with regards to your trading career? Yes, but the point is to develop a routine that you can consistently do without burning out.

&#x200B;

#### Making your routine fun.

Writing down your accomplishments is a form of discipline. It's also fun. I suggest checking out r/journaling, r/bujo, and r/fountainpens. Write down your routine in your journal the night before, review them when you wake up, and check them off as you go along.

Writing things down is a great way to keep track of your achievements, and it can act as an extension of your trade journaling.

&#x200B;

#### Prioritize and execute.

Our goal as novice traders is not to become the most skilled, disciplined trading hero that can flex on other trading communities. Our goal is to go through the first 2-4 years of trading without burning through our capital, while learning something new each day, and slowly develop our discipline and mindset.

We don't *need* to add more things to our routine, or read more books on TA and learn other strategies/methods/indicators.  Not at this stage. Many of us are here are over-achievers (start something new -> be awesome -> burn out), and we like to think that doing more is achieving more.

Instead, I think we should look to cut back on the excess (great [guideline](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/ygshk4/effective_and_ineffective_ways_to_spend/) written by our friend u/ZanderDogz shows you how to do this) and just focus on what matters most.

&#x200B;

Prioritize, execute.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

#### TLDR, in summary

If you feel a little burned out from trading -- do you think doing the "swap method" (cutting back on some of your trading routine to incorporate a new discipline in your life outside of trading) will positively impact your trading journey?

&#x200B;

Do you have your own discipline/routine that you might want to recommend to others?
