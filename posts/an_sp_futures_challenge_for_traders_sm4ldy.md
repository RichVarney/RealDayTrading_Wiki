**First** \- Get the Market Right

**Second** \- Get the Stock Right

If you do those two things you are 90% there - at that point it is just matter of maximizing your profits with the right trade (stock, options, spreads), and of course exit/entry.  But if you get the first two steps correct - you're going to have a profitable trade.

However, that is easier said than done.  For the second step it is all about having the right scanners, setting alerts, and picking the best stocks from those lists.  But what about the first step?

Reading the market and correctly identifying both the immediate trend and short-term direction is, as many of you know, *extremely* difficult.

The Wiki (**RTDW!**) provides a guide on how to analyze trends in **SPY**, and there are various indicators that can help - but in the end there is no substitute for pure *experience.*

So this "*challenge*" is meant to help you build that experience - here's what you do (I am using the Ameritrade ticker of /ES and /MES to refer to S&P Future contracts):

Start with $3,500 - the /MES or micro-mini's on S&P futures are worth 1/10th per contract of the regular /ES contract.

The regular /ES contract gives you +/- $12.50 per tick up or down, four ticks ($50) equals 1 point.  As a general rule, for every 10 cents **SPY** moves, that will equal 1 point on /ES.  So if you are long /ES Futures, and **SPY** goes up a dollar, that is 10 points on /ES or $500 per contract.  If you trade 4 contracts, than 10 points a day ($2,000) can provide enough income to make a decent living off alone.

However, it is not easy to get 10 points a day on /ES, and it takes a *lot of practice*.  Fortunately, they have /MES.  Being worth 1/10th of /ES, one tick on /MES is worth $1.25 - with one point equaling $5.

The margin requirement for /ES is $16,600 per contract - so if you wanted to play 2 contracts you would need at least $33,200 in your account.  With /MES you need $1,660 per contract.

***Futures trading does not abide by PDT rules, meaning you can Day Trade them all you want.***

Keep in mind, there are fees associated with these trades, so if you start trading 7 /MES contracts, which gives you $8.75 per tick, you'll be paying around $13 in fees, meaning you need at least 2 ticks just cover it.  Whereas the fees for just 1 /ES contract is roughly $3.50.

So now that is explained, here is the challenge:

Starting with $3,500 - you can trade 2 /MES contracts.  Your goal? Work your way up to being able to trade 1 /ES contract - or $16,600 in the account.

Every time you add $1,660 to your account, you increase your /MES size by 1 contract.  So when you hit $4,980 for example, you can use 3 /MES and $6,640 will give you the ability to go to 4 /MES contracts, etc.  Every time you "level up" you are getting a higher return per tick.  You are also risking more as well.

The goal is to learn how to anticipate **SPY** , you are not "scalping" here, and should be very careful with your *stops* as the current volatility will certainly trigger them.  You will need to learn patience with these trades, but also not let them get away from you (you do not want to be sitting on an /MES trade that is down 50 Points and would take a week to recover).  You also do not want to end the day with an /MES trade on while your Option Buying Power is negative - that will result in a Futures Margin Call and they *will* call you and charge you fees.

The idea of this exercise is to learn how to read **SPY.**  Doing this on a Paper account is an even safer bet.

A pro-trader can take a $3,500 account and get it to $16,600 using only /MES trades in about 1-2 months time.   So you can use that as a benchmark to see how well you are *reading the market*.  Completing this challenge in less than 2 month is *extremely impressive* and indicates your skills on reading the market are very much on point.

There are lots of posts on *how to read the market*, so I figured I would make one on how to test your ability to do just that.

Best, H.S.
