One of the biggest mistakes novice day traders make is they turn on their computer screens like a child opens presents on Christmas morning. They are barely awake and the adrenaline is pulsing through their bodies. The excitement has been building since the previous close. FOMO sets in and they're afraid that they are going to miss the next big move. They recall that the market closed above a resistance level yesterday and they see that it is gapping higher this morning. They "know" it's heading higher so they start buying right away. After 30 minutes they regret that decision because they could have entered all of the positions at a better price. Now the market looks rather weak and they're frustrated with themselves... "I did it again". They know it's going to take all day to recover from this mistake. They take their lumps and they step away from their screens. Sound familiar?

Your trading day should start at least two hours before the open. Read the overnight headlines and assess the overnight price action in global markets (Europe and Asia) and the S&P 500. This is your backdrop. Is it bullish or bearish? Is there any economic news that is going to be released an hour before the open? If there is, watch the market reaction right after it hits. You'll know instantly if it is going to have an impact on the action. Is the market going to open above or below any key technical levels? What might that breach look like on a daily chart? Does the market have a full head of steam in that direction or are we just going to poke at that level? Is the market going to gap higher/lower? Is the gap going to clear the prior day's high or low? How will I know if this is a "Gap and Go" or a "Gap Reversal"? Which of the two scenarios is most likely and which one presents the best trading opportunities? Is this a pre-holiday session with a flat open inside of the prior day's range? Has the trading volume been light recently? All of these questions need to be answered. They are going to lay the foundation for your trading day. You will NOT have this information on the opening bell.

Develop resources for your news. Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Fox Business News, Marketwatch, Wall Street Journal, ForexFactory, Benzinga, and Investors Business Daily are major media outlets. Bookmark the sites you like and develop a research routine.

Next, you should review your positions. Are any of your stocks moving before the open? What is the surrounding news? How will you manage those positions? Which stocks are making big overnight moves? Are they breaking through major technical levels? What is driving that stock? Could there be tangent plays for stocks that belong to that group? How does the stock normally behave? Does it have a habit of surging higher on the open and then giving the gains back or does it have steady price action? What has the volume been like recently? Is this stock move related to an earnings release? If yes, what has the stock done after previous earnings releases (look for previous earnings releases on a D1 chart).

Now you are staring to get a feel for how the market might open and you have your list of stocks that might be of interest. Draw your trendlines and drop your alert lines. If those price points are breached you can review the stock at that moment and the trades will be delivered to you on a "silver platter".

If you put your time in before the open, you have time to devise a game plan. You will be observing and stalking instead of running around with your head cut off. Your preparation will greatly reduce your anxiety. When the opening bell rings you can take gains on winning positions if that is part of your game plan. Once you've done that, get out of your chair and calmly get yourself a cup of coffee. Take a deep breath and stretch. You deserve it since you've already been at this for a couple of hours. You are prepared and you can use a little break. You don't plan on trading the first 30 minutes anyway... right!? When you come back to your screen you will have price data that you can analyze.  Did the breakout hold? Are you seeing stacked candles or are they mixed and overlapping? What does the SPY volume look like? Are the stocks you highlighted performing? Do they have relative strength and heavy volume?

After doing this for decades I can tell you with confidence that you do not EVER have to chase the open. That is "amateur hour" and it is a time for evaluation. You need data to make good day trading decisions. Sure, you might have to pay more for a stock 45 minutes after the open, but your odds of success will be much higher and you will avoid costly errors. You will have confirmation that there's a strong market tailwind on good volume. You will see the orderly grind higher in the stocks you are tracking and you can see the relative strength. Some of your picks will be performing better than others and you will know where to focus your attention. You might also find some new prospects that you had not considered before the open. Instead of managing losing positions from your impulse buying, you will calmly be evaluating and entering attractive trades.

I can give you countless examples of how waiting would have helped you this year, but let's look at the action from Wednesday (1/25/23). The market had been testing the D1 downtrend line from January 2022. We've seen resistance at that level during the last two months. MSFT tanked after releasing earnings (Tuesday after the close) and the S&P 500 was down 45 points before the open. It was going to test the 200-day MA. In the first 30 minutes, the SPY made a new low of the day and the 200-day MA was breached on a long red candle. Many traders "bit" on that move. At best it was worthy of a small initial short, we needed confirmation (follow through). Instead, there was an instant bounce (2 green candles). Bears did not want to see that so early in the breakdown. Within 15 minutes we started to see mixed candles with overlap. That was a sign of support and it was time to take gains on the small bearish starter positions. It was also a time to consider longs. Bearish traders who aggressively shorted the open were vulnerable. When the bounce came, they were scrambling to cover their mistakes instead of entering long positions. The trap was set for the amateur's. The market instantly took out the high of the day and it went into the gap. The annotated chart  below reflects my real-time comments from the chat room.

Start your day two hours before the open. Devise your game plan and and adjust any open positions that need to be addressed. Don't enter any new trades on the open. Instead, take a break and relax for 30 minutes. When you come back you will have avoided temptation and you will have new information to analyze. Now you can see which scenarios are playing out and you can execute your game plan.
