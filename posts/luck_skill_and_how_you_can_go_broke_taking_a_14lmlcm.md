The reason most traders lose money is because they cut their winners too soon and hold their losers too long.

There is nothing original about that statement - it's obvious.  It's correct, but it is also super fucking obvious.  

It also doesn't help when people say stupid shit like, "You'll never go broke taking a profit!"  Yeah, you will, in fact many times that is *exactly* why you are going broke.  

The Wiki goes into length about the reasons why this occurs, and also offers practical solutions that can help you prevent it from happening ([The Damn Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/wiki/index/)).  

Still, even when given the practical fixes, the problem remains for so many traders.  While some are able to apply the solutions detailed out in the Wiki, others just cannot seem to get over this huge roadblock to becoming a successful trader. Why?

**Deep down - you still believe your gambling.** 

A professional trader knows the methods work, they understand the edge they have and not because they have watched someone else do it but rather because *they* have done over and over again.  They know their personal statistics, and have little worry about hitting their monthly targets.  In other words, they know it isn't luck.  One simply cannot get consistently lucky month after month.  it is a bit like how a professional poker player knows that while others may be gambling, they are not.  To paraphrase the movie Rounders, there is a reason the same people dominate the leaderboards at every poker tournament.   

For those that haven't reached that stage though, there is doubt.  It may be doubt in their own abilities, doubt that the market isn't just "fixed against them" or doubt that being a professional trader is an actual professional one can achieve. It could be all of these (and in many cases it is exactly that).  

So what happens when you do not have confidence that the results of your trading is based on skill - when part of you believes you are gambling. 

In order to understand that you need to view profit-taking/bag-holding through that lens - 

To borrow some terms from Tom Hougaard (and if you haven't listened to him, I highly recommend it), consider how fast your hope can turn into fear while you are in a trade.  

Lets say you are holding **NVDA Puts,** and after yesterdays bullish price action you are hoping for a reversal.  Today it looks like your wish has been answered and **NVDA** starts to drop.  As you get closer to breakeven and possibly even profit you get more hopeful that you can actually get out of the trade without taking a loss.  

Then the strangest thing happens - the closer you get to breakeven, the more worried you become.  Maybe you should just exit now?  Are you really going to hang in just to get another 25 cents on the Option?  What if it reverses? **NVDA** can be a fucker, not like **SNOW**, nobody likes **SNOW**, but still a fucker nonetheless. Then, *BOOM*, a quick drop and now you are in profit - holy hell.  

Now that you are in profit, what was simply worry quickly turns into downright anxiety.  No way are you going to let this position go back into the red.  So you exit with a small profit feeling quite proud of yourself.  

*Consider how truly extraordinary this is - when you were wrong you were hopeful that the position would reverse in your favor, and when you were right is when you became fearful it would reverse against you.*

Doesn't make sense, does it? You had more faith when you were wrong than when you were right.

Except it does make sense because unlike the professional trader you have not experienced a consistent return with a method or strategy.  In fact, in your experience your wins and losses look a lot like, well, gambling.  Some nice wins, some big losses, and overall you are down.  The more you trade to more you lose in the end.  Just like a casino. 

You are injecting the element of "luck" into trading which translates into thoughts like:

*Rooting for losing positions to turnaround:* If there is a randomness to trading, then why shouldn't it turn in your direction as well? Hell, you are **due**.

*Fearful of winning positions reversing:* Not only *can* the market take away your profit, it probably *will* take it away, just like it has many times.

This is where your head really screws with you.  We are conditiond to have significantly better recall of negative events than positive ones (the evolutionary benefit of this is fairly obvious), so to the best of our recollection the market *does* tend to take away our winners. 

Therein lies the issue - an overall lack of faith that what you are doing is guided by a statistical edge, and a biased memory.  They combine to make a potent emotional deterrent to staying in and/or adding to winning trades.

*Great, but how does one fix it?*

Well, you never really do - I still get that nagging feeling even now.  You can control it though. 

This is why it is so important to:

**1) Go through the process - yes it is two years of hard work, but it takes you from paper trading to trading one share only after you are able to achieve a 75% WR and 2+ PF for three straight months using the method each time.  Do you need a 75% WR to be profitable? Hell no - but you need it to deal with all that emotional baggage.** 

**2) Stop fucking around with different indicators or trying to put your own twist on the method.  The method works, it is proven, and I am out here proving it every day. Yeah, I get it, nobody likes paper trading. Guess what? You're not unique in your distaste for the emotional disconnection one has when trading with fake money.  Yeah, I understand you don't want to just trade 1 share, and think, "Maybe I'll use 4 or 5 shares instead, just so it can feel more "real"".  Fucking, no. Just no.  That isn't the point of the exercise which is to literally train your brain to realize that you DO have an edge. Remember: You can cognitively tell your brain that you aren't gambling, you can try to force yourself to hold on to winners longer or add to them, but in the end it will just wind up compounding the problem.**  

**3) Don't just read the Wiki - study it. Every single day I get asked countless questions from people that starts with, "I've read the Wiki but can't seem to find...." and pretty much every time the answer is right there. Not even buried in some section, but front and center.**  

Most people spend two years losing their money, trying countless different methods and strategies, paying for scam courses, and then walk away dejected (usually mumbling something about a conspiracy against them).  If you want to do that, fine, I can't stop you. 

Or you can follow the ten-steps (and do not even think of asking what the 10 Steps are....it is in the damn Wiki) and this way you can spend two years learning a skill.  A skill that can turn into a full-time career with complete autonomy and financial independence. All while losing almost no money, and coming out the other side ready to load up your account, with the mindset needed to be consistently profitable.   

Best, 

H.S.
