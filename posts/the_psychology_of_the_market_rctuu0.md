As short-term traders we focus a lot of technical analysis - as we should.  Technical analysis is sort of a Rosetta Stone for telling the story behind these charts.   However, as we layer indicator after indicator on to our green & red candlesticks it is easy to forget that they represent - *Buyers* and *Sellers*.

Now granted trying to understand the motivations of *Buyers* and *Sellers* is difficult when they are primarily algorithms (as u/onewyse points out in his recent post) -but algorithms are still written by people with goals in mind (at least for the moment they are....AI isn't that advanced....yet).  

**Let's look at SPY:**

Look at each dip - back in July SPY tested the SMA 50, but it wasn't a serious attempt - one quick little touch and buyers were convinced the price will hold. **SPY** proceeds to climb 6% until 8/17-8/19 where in what can only be described as a "bless their hearts" attempt, SPY doesn't even get to the SMA 50.  Everything is fine for awhile and then 9/9 to 9/17 sellers take over and begin to build confidence.  With a running start of five red trading days they crash right through the SMA 50 as if it wasn't there. Bolstered by their unobstructed run, Sellers get a bit cocky and head to the SMA 100, hitting it and going below it.  At this point people are talking about the SMA 200 being next, and alarm bells are going off - remember? It wasn't that long ago.   A sigh of relief was taken when buyers jumped SPY back to the SMA 50 and on 9/24 it seems that Bears will foiled again!  But before Admiral Akbar could say, "It's a Trap!", BAM - Bulls are holding the bag!  You can see Bears trying to climb out of the fetal position they've been in these 10+ years.   It wouldn't be until 10/19 that it became clear things were back on track.  SPY then goes on a huge run, breaking all-time highs every week.    And then....we stall, with a low volume compression, and finally on 11/26 Bears try again.  

What does this all tell you?  It is clear that right now one would expect SPY to be establishing a new ATH, but it isn't yet....

What about Christmas you say?  Or Holidays? Or whatever the hell you want to call this time of good will....well historically SPY goes up, because...Santa.  But these days things don't seem to fit historical trends, probably because of these damn kids with their iPods and their fancy Nintendo 64's playing with Robinhood on some old flip phone; however, you want to look at it - you can't depend on the past like you used to - it *should* go up, it's *supposed* go up, doesn't mean it *will* go up. 

Still what you can depend on is- *human psychology* \- when you look back at the dip in September it took quite a lot to convince Sellers to throw in the towel.  But if you look closely at it there is something there that gave them that confidence to keep trying to drive the market down - ***Bulls couldn't get above the SMA 50 and stay there***.  If you notice, every time Buyers bring the price over the SMA 50 and manage to keep it above, Sellers give up.  

On 12/7 that is exactly what happened - and then yesterday and today we stayed above it.  I believe what we are looking at is not Sellers in control, but rather a well-defined Bull Flag.  In fact, I feel that Bulls are confident enough to engage in Bear traps, which you see several times on the 5 minute intra-day charts.  You probably fell for a few, you know the moment you say, "I am going to short stocks now..." and then the door is slammed in your face?  Yeah, those.

Now, like always, the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent, as the saying goes - but I am interpreting the current set-up as bullish.  I believe we go up tomorrow, and then surge over the All-time-High next week.

We shall see.....$464.50 is the gap, if SPY goes into that gap, then I am obviously wrong.

Best, H.S.
