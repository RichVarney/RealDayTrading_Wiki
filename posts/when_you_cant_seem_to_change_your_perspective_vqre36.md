*Everyone* enters the trading day with a bias.

Even though you constantly hear "**Trade what's in front of you!**" (*and you should*) , anyone that tells you they don't have a bias before the day starts, is a lying liar face.

So how does this impact your trading?  Consider this:

*How often has this scenario happened to you:*

Using this Friday as an example - Before the market opens you have a *Bearish* mindset (it could be a *Bullish* mindset, but for this example, let's assume it is *Bearish*), whether it is based in deep technical analysis or simply your constantly inaccurate but often listened to gut, you feel that market is going to keep going down.

The market opens and **SPY** is posting some solid red bars, confirming your thesis - an hour in and we are at $374, so naturally, you're shorting.  Maybe it's **MOS** or **META**, some puts, short some shares, throw a little *Put Debit Spread* on there why don't you, and you are ready to ride the *Bear Wave*.

You are about to type, "Told you all it was going down..." and then **SPY** reverses - a little at first, and it begins to chop around - You hold on to your shorts because...this chop is obviously going to break back to the downside soon, right?   It's just a little blip and your shorts aren't in that bad of shape actually.  In your head you begin to come up with reasons for why **SPY** isn't dropping - *Short covering, testing VWAP, low volume*....all potentially valid, right?  Either way, you said this shit is going down and you meant it!

But it doesn't drop. And around 1:30pm (est) that little blip up becomes a big blip real fast.

It keeps climbing..

And then by the time you finally say, "Screw it - I believe", you now think you have missed the move (you didn't, but that's for another post).

So now you are sitting there - you lost money on your shorts and you're afraid to go long.  Basically, you are stuck, and in a deep hole.

All because it took too long for you to change your perspective.

***This is one of the biggest problems for traders - the inability to quickly switch from their original predisposition to one that is staring them right in the face***.

*So how does one solve this?*

I can tell you how **not** to solve it - staring at your screen trying to will a candlestick chart to switch directions and getting overly excited when you see one candle go your way is *definitely* ***not*** it. It is also no way to spend an afternoon.

There are many "mental tricks" one can do to reframe the way you are looking at the charts.  But if you are looking for that magic *confirmation* where the screen flashes, "Hey dumbass, you were wrong", you aren't going to find it (although I am sure you could program something like that, which would be rather funny).   The reason you won't find the Technical confirmation telling you that your bias was off? Simple - You don't believe them when you see them.  When your bias is driving your decisions, Technical Confirmation gets rationalized away to keep you trading in the direction you just know, deep down, is going to be right.

This is especially true in Chop.  Because that is what chop does - it screws with you.  And it is filled with *Bull* and *Bear* *Traps* that play to those biases.  Look at Friday's chart here:

In order to solve a problem you need to first better understand it and that starts with recognizing that there are two types of bias that can cloud one's judgement.

**Relative Bias:**

When you see the price on a stock, it is hard not to put it into the larger perspective, right?  For example, when you look at **COIN** sitting there at $46.93 - in your head that is *down*.  It is hard not to remember that it used to be almost $400.  So you think of the stock/price as being ***down relative to what it once was.***

Normally this is extremely important, you need to look at any trade in the larger historical context. That is why we use Technical analysis to see the chart *over time*. In fact, it is so ingrained in us, that it is difficult to see the price of any ticker outside of its' history.  **TSLA** is at $670.02, but that is *down* quite a bit from $1,243.

It is also why we think of some stocks as being "on sale", and the often used phrase, "Buy low, sell High" because it is based on a time perspective.  How else is one to know that something is "low" unless you are thinking of it compared to when it was "high".

However, the truth is that a stock's price is a *subjective value* that almost never reflects the actual value of the company.  It is an inflated number based on countless projections, not just for the company/brand, but the industry as a whole.

For example, the actual value of **AAPL** is around $55 to $60 a share - that is what the company is worth if it were to be broken down by real assets.  **NOW** which currently goes for $483 is worth closer to $50.

The point is that a stocks price is *extremely subjective* and the market is nothing more than a macro-representation of every stock, which means the market itself is just as *subjective*.

A few months ago you saw **SPY** at $455 as being "down"**.  How would you view SPY at $455 now?** Completely the opposite.

This get amplified even more when you are looking at shorter time-frames.

The other type is **Trend Bias:**

These days when we look at the market, the expectation, for most, is that is going to be down.  You can only have so many red days in a row before you give up on your bullish dreams and flip over to the dark side.  Every Green bar is just a *bounce* and a good *shorting* opportunity.

Once again, this is normally extremely important and exactly how you should trade - *Go with the trend*.

But when the market is showing you every indication that it is going up (at least for that day), it can be disastrous to continue believing we are going to reverse at some point.

And that is is double-edged sword here:

On the one hand, both of these forms of bias are legitimate and necessary outlooks one needs to have in order to trade correctly.

On the other when that bias is proven to be incorrect one needs to know when to let go and believe what they seeing.

For example, right now I am *Bullish* on **SPY/Market**, only short-term, but I believe this next week should see a decent bullish bounce.

***But at what point on Tuesday should I relieve myself of that notion if proved otherwise?***

What if **SPY** drops $4 on the open down to $378?

Well I can certainly tell myself that $378 is support, I can further point to Friday where **SPY** dropped $4 in the morning and then rebounded.

Rational enough - so should I keep my bullish mindset?

Let's call this point the **Rational Line in the Sand**.

This is the moment where any further rationalizations become *irrational.*  You actually know this moment when it happens - because this is where you start looking for anything to grab on to that proves your thesis.  Every Green Bar becomes a "Finally, the reversal I was looking for!"

It is also the moment where you believe *everyone else to be wrong*.

We all remember days when the market made a surprising reversal leaving the majority the dust - so there are examples of when *everyone was wrong* before - and in your head, this is one of those times.  Except is about to be wrong, except for you, the glorious genius that is you, you are going to be right.  How amazing will that feel?

It will feel like crap, because it won't happen, because you aren't right, you have past that *line in the sand*. You are now *irrational*.

Ask yourself the following questions:

**1)** How would your argument sound if someone else were making it? Would you not argue against it?

**2)** Can you point to widely used indications on the chart to support your point or are you stretching beyond the realm of everyday use?  For example - ***Normal*** *- "We are still above VWAP and have bounce off major support on the Daily",* ***Not Normal*** *- "The 37 EMA was just breached" or "Volume is decreasing on the 4-Hour time-frame which historically means...."*  The more esoteric your explanations are, the more likely you are trying to justify an incorrect position.

**3)** Are you using the "Its Gotta" method? Any argument that relies on the "Its Gotta" logic is going to get your into trouble.  It tends to sound like this, "Its gotta turn around here at some point...."

**4)** Am I in the minority here?  And in this sense I am talking about the *small minority*.  If everyone is going Long, and all the volume is on the Bullish side for that day - are you one of the only traders looking for Shorts?

**5)** Do I just not want to take the loss? Am I afraid to take the loss and then be proven right? **This is probably the biggest one - are you still committed to your direction because not only do you not want to take the loss, but you imagine closing the trade only to then be finally proven right.**  There is nothing more frustrating than to be Long a position, it has dropped and you are down a lot, but you still believe it will go back up.  You finally close it and up it goes.

If you know you would argue the point if someone else were making it, if you can't point to any regularly used form of TA to support your point, if you are relying on pure hope, if everyone else is doing the opposite and if you are simply afraid to take the loss - then you know you have passed that ***line of rationality.***

Whether you are down in a trade or the market is doing the opposite of what you thought, there has to come a moment where you realize - "Shit - I was wrong", and it is your job as a trader to make sure you don't overstay your mistake.

Best, H.S.
