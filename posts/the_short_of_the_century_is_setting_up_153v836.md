Inflation is still running way above the target rate and core inflation could take years to normalize. The Fed knows this and that is why they are likely to hike interest rates a week from now. We’ve already seen two of the largest bank failures and there are more to come as rates move higher. Short sellers are salivating and they are certain that this is a buying climax. The title was meant to grab your attention because many of you are shorting or contemplating it here. 

I have been urging traders not to short and I’ve had “gurus” challenging me on that. I don’t even bother responding because I know they will be wiped out soon. It is critical to trade what is in front of you and not what you think is going to happen. 

Brokerage firms have been wrong all year. Look at the projections they had for the end of 2022 and look at the forecasts they have for 2023. They were way too high last year and way too low this year. Now they are scrambling to adjust. 

In December of 1996 Fed Chairman cited “irrational exuberance” and a dot com bubble. The next 5 years were some of the biggest market gains we have ever seen. 

My point is this. Don’t trade what you read. Most analysts are wrong! Trade what you see. Price does not lie. 

So here is where we currently stand. Yes, the market has staged a great rally and there are plenty of dark clouds, but that does not mean that you start shorting now. Earnings season is just starting and short sellers are passive ahead of these announcements. Mega cap tech stocks have been posting great numbers and they have been fueling this rally. We can expect higher prices for at least a few weeks. The charts below show you how strong this period is. In 2020 we were in a pandemic and the market rallied. In 2021 we were in a bull market and the market rallied. In 2022 we were in a bear market and stocks shot higher. In 2023 we are seeing similar. 

Don’t chase, buy dips. Let the position run and when it hits resistance take gains. You know this from my article yesterday. Yes, there are instances where the stock keeps running and it does not dip. You have to be willing to let them go without you. Most stocks will retrace and the red candles on the D1 chart remind you of this. This strategy provides a good entry point that is close to support. If the unexpected happens and the stock has another leg lower, you will be able to observe the price action near recent support. If that support fails easily, your loss is small because you only have a starter position on and you entered close to support. Buying on the dip provides you with excellent upside. The stock has already cleared the path higher once and it should be able to get back to that relative high again. Based on how it attacks that resistance, it could blow through it and provide even more upside. When the stock hits resistance, take gains. Doing so will put you in a cash position and you will be able to gauge risk from the sidelines. If the drop has consecutive stacked red candles and heavy volume, beware. There is more downside to come. If the market breaks the up trendline and key support levels, you might have a meaningful decline that you can short. 

You will also notice in the charts below that by the middle of August we see some selling pressure. We are not predicting when the breakdown will happen, we are mindful of the seasonal weakness and we wait for technical breaches.
