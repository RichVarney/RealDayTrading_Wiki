You may notice a familiar pattern in your thinking - 

SPY drops - It'll bounce, I am bullish

SPY drops more - Yeah, not convinced, still bullish here

SPY spirals down - Ok - still think it will reverse, but I am waiting 

SPY shockingly keeps dropping - Fine! You got me, I am bearish, happy now??

SPY starts going up - No way I am falling for that bullshit - totally bearish

SPY keeps going up - Nice trick there - nope, bearish all the way

SPY begins to leap up - Ok - still think it will reverse, but I am waiting

SPY hits all-time highs - Fine! You got me, I am bullish, happy now??

SPY starts to drop....

Does that sound familiar?

Realize this - *those algorithms know everything about your patterns, they know your psychological limits, and exactly when you will given in to the trend, which is when the trend reverses.*

***Know what they know, do what they do, recognize the trends and where they start and stop.  Put yourself in the shoes of Institutions and trade that way.*** 

Best, H.S.
