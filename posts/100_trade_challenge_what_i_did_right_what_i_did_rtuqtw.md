The challenge is basically done - depending on **GOOGL** and **AAPL** next week, I will either be over $100K in profit or somewhere around $75K.   Either way, it is a good time to look back and see what mistakes I made and how I can use that knowledge to improve my trading in 2022.

*(Also since the $5K challenge will be starting, the TraderSync log will be replaced with that one as I can only have one up at a time, although I will give a final update on the 100 trade challenge when the remaining positions close)*

My overall win percentage was 92.5% with a profit factor 

I paid $3,382.14 in Commissions/Fees over the 109 trades (I need to once again negotiate these down further with Ameritrade)

My performance was the least profitable between noon and 1pm (pst).  

Relatively Weak stocks and stocks that had a big gap up were the two set-ups that had the lowest returns.  Whereas Relatively Strong stocks with Good Relative Volume and Strong Daily Charts were the best performers.

The two biggest mistakes were clear:

**1)** *Exiting Too Early -* while there were times I exited my position with absolute pinpoint accuracy, there were also times I took profit way too early.  The set up was correct, and after I exited, the stock continued to run in the direction of the trade.  

**Solution -** In the future when I have a profitable position, but I am looking to exit not because of any technical violation or reversal, but rather concern about the market or simply hitting my target price, I will attempt to *scale out* of the position instead of closing the entire trade.  Obviously if I am exiting because the price action is showing a reversal, or the stock is losing volume I will take all profits - but if the set-up remains intact, I will keep 1/4 to 1/2 of the position running.

**2)** *Staying too long -* While remaining in some losing trades worked out quite well (e.g. **TGT** or **RBLX**) in other cases it did not (notably **AMZN** or **AAPL**).  In particular this was among option trades that were quickly losing value as they approached expiration.  I stayed in these positions even though my original thesis no longer applied.  While I have always been a trader that buffered 2 or 3 large losses out of every 100 trades with the large amount of profit generated from the winning side - there is no reason not to lower the hit I am taking on the losers.

**Solution -** There are several. With the exception of the lotto losses (which are to be expected considering they are....lottos), I could have been more aggressive in selling options against those positions to mitigate the loss.  I did this on occasion but should have been doing it daily - so I definitely left money on the table by not turning my losing options into spreads.  The other more obvious solution here is to be quicker to take the loss rather than let the trade run.  In most cases I was shorting weak stocks in a strong market.  It took me too long to switch off my bearish market bias (the feeling that the market is going to drop soon) and because of that I didn't fully see what was in front of me - a very bullish trend in SPY.  When SPY is *that* strong it doesn't matter how weak the stock might appear, it is going to be very difficult to get traction with your shorts when they aren't going your way immediately.

Doing some very quick and rough math, if I just took a half-hour walk around noon my time, scaled out of my winning positions that still had a good set-up, was more aggressive about selling premium against my losing option trades, and taking a quicker loss on trades that are directionally against the market, I would have increased my profits by close to 40%.  

The results of this challenge are pretty much in line with my yearly averages - my actual win rate is closer to 89% and the average loss size is smaller, still, overall it seems to fit.  

Obviously I can continue doing quite well without making any changes, but in order to remain successful one has to constantly evolve and learn.  While there were no surprises here for me (these same mistakes would pop up if I ran the analysis on the prior 100 trades, or the 100 trades before that and so on), seeing them in a public light definitely puts emphasis on my need to address the issues.  

I hope you all found this exercise helpful - and now on to the $5K Challenge!

Best, H.S.
