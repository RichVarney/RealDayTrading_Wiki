*I have no idea how to make this a sticky at the top of the sub, so if anyone knows how to do that, please tell me.*

Let's face, there are tons of subreddits and forums on trading.  The pandemic has driven many people into becoming retail traders, some looking to make longer terms investments, while others are YOLOing their life savings away.    Almost all of these forums claim they can help **you** make money somehow.

This forum r/RealDayTrading has a very specific purpose: ***Day Trading as a Career***.

*So if you do not believe that:*

**1) Day Trading can be Profitable**

**2)** **Day Trading can be** ***consistently*** **Profitable**

**3) Day Trading is** ***hard*** **and takes a lot of time to learn**

Then this is probably not the forum for you.

Unlike other places, this subreddit has actual professional Day Traders contributing.  They are here to teach you what they know, discuss strategies and offer advice.  *However*, they are not here to debate the viability of something they do every day.

As I am sure you read, we have a very strict no troll policy here.  Trolling will get you banned immediately.    

If you want to share your service, YouTube video, community, etc. I encourage you to do so.  The sharing of resources is important in learning.  *However -* it must be accurate and valuable. as judged by the mods. 

Furthermore, do not claim to be an expert in Day Trading unless you actually are one.  Nobody is going to ask for proof of anything here, that is a rabbit hole that this forum will not go down.  *However -* it will be very clear whether or not you know what the hell you are talking about.    There are new traders here looking for help and they will listen to what you tell them - if that advice is not correct it is going to wind up costing them money.  It is morally wrong to claim expertise. So don't.

Any decisions you make based on information received from this forum is *your responsibility*.  It should go without saying, but if you follow someone into a trade, you should have your own exit strategy for that trade, and not rely on the person that posted it to tell you what to do.

This forum is an incredibly unique opportunity for you to learn a skill that will be valuable to you for the rest of your life.  Just yesterday u/OptionStalker posted two detailed posts on reading SPY and the market.  Today u/Professor1970 , who is literally one of the only people out there (other than perhaps Ross from Warrior Trading) that makes an *extremely* profitable living through scalping, posted information on his method.  These posts are **pure gold**.  They never would have posted those anywhere else.  They and others will continue to contribute in order to help you all on this journey.  

Also - I do not care how large this community gets, I care more that the people here are ones that want to be here, and want to either learn or help others learn how to Day Trade for Living.  I honestly believe this place can become very special, but in the end that is of course up to all of us.

(Yes, it is after the character from the Isaac Asimov Foundation series - a book series that inspired me so much in my youth, my entire career path has been based on the concepts in those novels)
