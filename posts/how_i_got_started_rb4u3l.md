\*\*\*\* This was posted last year, but of course r/Daytrading took it down, as they did all my posts (since about half of their top 20 posts of all time were from me it makes perfect sense to remove them....dumbasses).  So I am reposting here and linking it back to the Wiki.

How did you get started?

When did you start being profitable?

Other than asking about resources, those are two very common questions. So I figured I would just put it down here, hopefully some of you find something useful out of the journey I took.

—

I grew up poor, like living in a car sharing a candy bar with my siblings as a once-a-week treat level of poor, but through hard work, education (and yes, the inherent built-in privledge of being born a white male in America) I wound up doing really well for myself. Five years ago, living in LA with my family, I got interested in trading. It wasn’t out of necessity, more because I kept hearing friends/colleagues talk about how much their investments were making. I’m way too arrogant to think they could do it and I couldn’t, so I looked into it. And investing seemed....boring. Not that I don't have long term investments, I do, but the idea of finding an edge in the market on a day-to-day basis was too enticing to ignore. Long term, it made sense that reductions in the corporate tax rate and lifting regulations would jolt the market (bad for the economy long term in my opinion), so I bought your basic stocks and did fine with them, still do to this day.

But Day Trading caught my eye, and I started watching videos. Quickly it became obvious that if a video started off with a Ferrari or Lambo, to just click next. It immediately became clear that the more popular this space became, the more corrupt it was, and the more vultures were out to fleece people. Made me sick to see.  Still, among all the crap, there were some that made sense. So I ordered a bunch of books and read them. Learned chart patterns, option trading, indicators, you know, all the basic technical analysis info. I’m the type that before I do something I like to know as much about as I can. The whole “90% fail” mantra didn’t deter me. Why? Well, as I said, I’m arrogant so I figured I would be in that 10%, and experience has taught me that most people fail because they don’t put in the work.  Turns out that is exactly why so many fail - they simply do not put in the work required.

When I felt I learned enough I put $50k in an Ameritrade account, took some Thinkorswim tutorials, popped some pharmaceuticals and was ready to trade.

I promptly got my ass handed to me. Hard. Typical story here - $50k became $100k became $3k. Yeah I didn’t know shit. Six months of studying and I still screwed up as badly as possible. I thought I could anticipate the market - “This stock is going to go up, it HAS to!” rather than wait for confirmation.  I counter-trend traded thinking I knew better.

Not deterred, I put in another $50k (mistake). I figured, ok, my mental game is off, I’m still treating it like gambling. So I read all the books on mindset (Trading in the Zone by Douglas was actually good), and tried again. This is now one year in, and I improved. It’s 2017-2018 and there are still commissions, but I started to see real profit. And once again, I was a moron. At the end of the year SPY hit a bear run and go figure I found out I sucked at shorting stocks and using puts.  I also found that my early success at OTM Options was just luck. After two years my toolkit was still incomplete. I couldn’t trade in a bear market. But I thought I could! (arrogant remember?) The market quickly said, “No dumbass, you can’t”.

Now I’m down close to $100k. I hate giving up. I do well, but $100k was a lot of money, and it was kind of making me sick thinking what I could have done with it instead. I won't bore you with the next few months, but needless to say before I snapped out of it, I was down $150K.

So I decided to do two things. One - start again but this time with only $10k. If I couldn’t build that up to over $25k using a combo of swing trades and my three day-trades every week, I had no right to continue trying to be a trader (btw - I still do this challenge for myself, except now I do a $5k account to build up on the side). Second, I was sick of doing this alone, so I looked for a good community to join. As you might expect most were either scams or just basic crap they were charging me to relearn. However there were a few that actually seemed worth the money, and I finally settled on one which most of you know is OneOption . There I met traders who have been making a living doing this for over a decade. I was able to discuss trades and strategies, analyze what went wrong and get an outside opinion.  Seeing actual pro traders that depend on their profits to support themselves and their families, was invaluable. 

Well third time was the charm. I built it back with that $10k and by 2019, made back the $150k.

And now I am here - my last 100 trades has a win rate of 95% and a profit factor close to 40 (yes, that is right, 40) - I have 42 straight winning trades on SPY futures.  In short, I am a really good trader.  But it took dedication, patience, and time.  

It can be done, and it doesn’t have to cost the two years of frustration and the financial loss it did for me before learning how to do it.

Everyone’s journey is different, but hopefully you can learn something from mine to make yours a bit easier.
