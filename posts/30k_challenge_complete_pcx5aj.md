*The original goal was to double this account in four months time -* ***it took five weeks.***

***I did this challenge so that traders can see that it is possible to Day Trade for a living.  I sincerely hope that was accomplished.***  

***I gained nothing from doing this challenge, and I am not selling anything to anyone.  This was for all of you to learn from and use.  I will leave the public profile up as well.*** 

***From now on whenever someone says that this is impossible, or tries to tell you how many fail - show them this challenge.  I hope you all share this far and wide - you can even remove my name from it if you want, I just want people to know that if you put in the time and effort, learn solid trading strategies, that this is very doable.  If I shared it I am sure it would look self-serving, so by all means share it to help bring others to this sub so they can learn as well.***

*For those unaware of what this is and why -* 

**The Challenge:**

To double a $30K account within four months.

**The Rules:**

Starting with $30K, 4X Buying Power

Day Trading and Hold Overs

Using solid Day Trading principles - namely Relative Strength / Weakness to SPY (**note: this is** ***not*** **RSI or Beta**) and not Using *Gap N' Go* Low Float Cheap Stocks

Stocks - Options - Options Spreads - Futures all being used

**The Reason:**

If one reads through the trading subs on Reddit they would quickly come away with the impression that you can not make a living Day Trading. I know this isn't true. How? Because *I make my living Day Trading and have for many years, I also know others who do the same.*

However, misinformed posters claim that 95% fail, or that it is impossible to do no matter what. This is simply incorrect. The reason most fail is because they trade based on *gut* feeling and tend towards the cheap stocks with a lot of momentum (a strategy only very skilled traders should attempt). They do not put in the work required to Day Trade, which is roughly two years of studying and training.

***In other words, this shit is hard.***

So I decide to open up a separate account (my main account is not relatable given its' size) and prove that this can be done. I posted every trade live as I am doing them in [r/RealDayTrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/) and used TraderSync to keep the log of all the trades.

The log of all the trades since this started are here:

[https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021](https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021)

***Final Total: $60,744.09***

***Commissions and Fees Paid: $1,172.21***

***Wins: 235***

***Losses: 93***

***Win Rate: 71.6%***

***Break-even Trades: 44***

***A big win on SPRT pushed the account over the edge, but just like with the occasional mistake you will also get lucky on some trades as well.***

I still have some open positions in this account, but most of them are in profit (which would bring the totals even higher), I will close those on Monday - barring a catastrophic market crash I doubt very much they will lower the account below $60,000.

By far the set-up that was most profitable were stocks with Relative Strength/Weakness to SPY and correspondingly strong/weak daily charts.

The biggest mistakes were: *Holding too long* and *Pure Greed, No Analysis*

While I have enjoyed doing this for all of you, I also need to get back to focusing 100% on my main account.  Even though I made $30K doing this challenge, my average profit from my main account dropped roughly 30% over the past five weeks.  

At some point in the future I will do a challenge with only $5K as a starting point (with 3 Day Trades every 5 days, and a margin account) to show you how one can double that account as well.

\**the time zones on some of the tradersync charts seem a bit off to me so I have a message into their support team to clear it up.*

All the best - H.S.
