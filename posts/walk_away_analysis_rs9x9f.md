I came up with a different way to analyze whether or not you are picking the right stocks - 

At the end of the day, open a spreadsheet:

**Column 1:** ***Ticker***

**Column 2:** ***Long or Short***

**Column 3:** ***Price you entered (stock or option contract)***

**Column 4:** ***Price at closing (stock or option contract)***

**Column 5:** ***Profit or Loss on trade***

Then add up the totals in ***Column 5*** for a final total of either profit or loss for the day.

Essentially, what would have happened to all of your trades if after you made them you walked away from them - just let them finish out the day.  For example - you went long on **IRT** at 2pm for $25.01, how much would have you made if you just let it finish the day and didn't close the trade until right before the bell.

Then do the following:

**1) Is the total profits higher (or the loss lower) from** ***Column 5*** **than your actual P&L on the day?**

**2) What is your win rate on this spreadsheet compared to your win-rate on the day?  (if your win rate on this spreadsheet isn't higher than 50% you are not picking the right stock btw)**

**3) What is your average profit and average loss on this spreadsheet compared to your actual average for the day?**

If you do this each day, then at the end of each week you will have a really good sample of trades.  And the question is - would you have done better if you just took the trade, didn't look at it, and then closed it right at the end.  

This type of analysis can highlight for you the following:

**1)** How much intraday movement is really just noise.

**2)** Whether you are exiting too early on your trades

**3)** If you are picking stocks with staying power, or just gravitate to short-lived volume spikes

Because if the total profit in this scenario is higher than your actual profit you know you are picking good stocks, but aren't patient enough.  If you total profit is lower in this scenario you know you are picking the wrong stocks that only have a short-window of profitability.

Hope this helps, please let me know as I just thought of it today, but I am pretty sure it will be very useful to try.

Best, H.S.
