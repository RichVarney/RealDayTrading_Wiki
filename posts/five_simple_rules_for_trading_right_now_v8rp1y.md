***I want to stress - unless you are a consistently profitable trader - DO NOT TRADE THIS MARKET RIGHT NOW.***  

**Paper trade it, sure.  Study it, absolutely.  But do not use your money because you will lose it, and fast.  If you got lucky today, don't press it.** 

**Remember - somebody ALWAYS makes money.  You are either losing that money to a more experienced trader or to an Institution.**  

***And when you do trade (because I know some of you will) at the very least, use these five simple rules:***

**1)** If the market is choppy - do not trade - trade Paper account instead.

**2)** If the market isÂ down - do not go Long, only Short

**3)** If the market is up - do not go Short, only Long

**4)** Do not go Long on a stock that is Red for the day

**5)** Do not Short a stock that is Green for the day

It doesn't matter if all of a sudden a stock gets Relative Strength, if the market is down, **do not go Long**.  

It doesn't matter if suddenly news hits and **AMZN** starts dropping like a rock, if the market is up, **do not Short it.**

It literally cannot get any simpler than this - 

Best, H.S.
