I probably got asked around 15 times today if I am still in **ON** or in **MU.**  Aside from having to repeat, "I will always post an exit" over and over, it seems the concern behind those questions is universal enough to cover in one post.

Here is the first things to understand:

*Stocks do not just keep going up - they pause, they retreat.*

*You will never get the perfect entry, which means there are times the stock will pause or retreat after you go into the trade.*

*There is a difference between a pullback and when a stock is in trouble.*

And now I can hear all of you in unison saying, "That is where I am having a problem - when is it time to bail and when do I give it space? How do I know??"

Well you can never know 100% of the time - but you can know a vast majority of the time - and therein lies the power of the daily chart.

If you are Day Trading a stock, and you're currently up, or have no intention of holding the stock if you are down, then indicators like *VWAP* and the *8EMA* are your guides.  But if you enter a stock with a really strong daily chart, the benefit is that you can stop worrying about intraday **noise**.  Because that is what you are seeing, **noise.**  

Look at the daily charts for **MU** and **ON** \- **MU** gapped up today with strong relative strength against SPY, it has Algo line resistance at $88.50 (roughly), which gives it $2 to run before it hits.  **ON** is even stronger, with clear skies above it and no bag-holders.  The market is extremely bullish - putting in one of its strongest days of the past year - and if your mind immediately goes to, "Well it will probably go down now, right?" Stop it.  Stop thinking that way - Bullish means Bullish.  

Unless the intraday movement does something to fundamentally change the daily outlook, I honestly don't care...over the week it will most likely continue up...when it does, I will take profits.

I was in **DDOG** last week, it dropped $9, I held it and took profit this morning.  **MSFT** I held it after the drop, and now it is one of my best positions.

*Stop looking for reasons to exit a position - if you traded the correct set-up than have faith in that set-up.*  

I keep harping on looking at the *story*, and I know it takes time, but so many of you continue to focus on one page and not the whole book.  Make sure you are using the right position size for your trades, the right set-up and then let the trade work.  

Just imagine the total number of $ on any given trading day that is lost because trades hit a tight "stop", or you just "felt" it was going down too much and you wanted to cut your losses.  *Billions upon Billions*.   Don't add to that.  If you exit a trade, have a reason - a real reason.  Freaking out because it is currently down *is not a real reason.*

Best, H.S.
