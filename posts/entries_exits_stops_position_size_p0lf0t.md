I get a lot of questions about these four topics, so I figured I would address them in one post.

To begin with there is one crucial point that every trader needs to understand - 

**Get the market right, get the stock right.**

If you do these two things you have already accomplished the most important aspect of your trade. 

There are many great books, articles and videos out there on **Entries, Exits, Stops** and **Position Size,** that go into the technical aspects you need to know, so I am only going to touch on that aspect briefly.

Look at this chart:

This is a textbook Entry/Exit situation - **GS** gaps up, and an hour after the market opens the 3EMA remains solidly above the 8EMA - the stock has Relative Strength, and you can see on the chart where **SPY** begins to drops and **GS** starts to go up again - this is your *entry.*   About 2 hours later, the 3EMA and 8EMA meet, with the 8EMA moving on top, **SPY** begins to go up and **GS** remains flat - this is your exit.  This trade would have been a $4 winner.  

Is it always this easy? No.  But there are some traders who will wait all day, staring at charts and watching the market to find 1 or 2 of these setups.  They are high probability trades, and thus with a strong enough position size (either in shares or options) it only takes a couple of them a day to hit your daily goal.  However, most people do not have the patience to do sit on their hands for hours until they find the perfect trade (or the skill to recognize it when it happens).

An important question to ask yourself when making a trade is - ***What is my thesis?*** 

By this I mean, if you are entering a stock like **GS** at $393.90, and you think based on the market, the stocks strength, the historical ATR for **GS**, that it is at its' all-time high (i.e. no resistance above, no bag-holders looking to sell) etc. that you can get $2 out of this trade, your thesis is that **GS** will get to $395.90.

At that point, that is *all that matters*.  **GS** may dip back down to $393.50, it may consolidate, but all you care about is making $2 profit on the trade.  You shouldn't care that you could have gotten in cheaper at $393.50, because if **GS** did not violate any of the premises behind the trade (e.g. Relative Strength, 3/8 cross), nothing will have changed.   The entry doesn't matter here as much as your thesis does - because if you entered at $393.50, your thesis wouldn't have changed to making a profit of $2.40, it should now be a profit target at $395.50 (rather than the $395.90).  Either way your plan is to take $2 on this trade.

For some trades your thesis may be based on the daily chart, in which case the stock has even more leeway, as now you need to see a technical breakdown on the Daily chart rather than the 5 minute candles.  

You cannot take the mindset of **entry** and **exit** that you have on momentum trades and use that on your other day trades.  

As for position size, I have a post on this (as well as a worksheet) but let's dispel a few things you might currently believe:

\- The notion of only allocating a certain percent of your portfolio towards a trade is riddled with issues.  To begin with if you have $50,000, and thus $200,000 in buying power, and you want to buy 2,000 shares of a $100 stock, *you are not risking the entire $200,000*.  You are only risking as much as the nearest technical breakdown.  If on that $100 stock you plan on exiting around $99.40 as that is just under *VWAP* (for example), than you are only risking 60 cents \* 2,000 = $1,200.  

\- Your level of risk should be determined by the technical charts, not by your P&L.  If instead of using the technicals in the above example, you set your limit at a $1,000 loss, than you would be exiting at $99.50 and very likely missing that bounce off VWAP which was just a bid-check for the stock.

\- For the same reason, you should not be looking at Risk | Reward unless you are determining the appropriate debit or credit on a spread.   Your "reward" should be based on the technicals. Again in the above example, if that stocks loses Relative Strength at $100.30, you should exit.  So what does that mean?  It means that you were risking $1,200 to make $600.  Which means that trade would need to be successful more than 66% of the time.  

\- This now goes back to your journaling of your trades and making sure you enter in the setups you are using on each trade.  If you have been doing that, it should be fairly easy to check how often the particular set up you are using is successful.  

On position size just ask yourself:

\- Am I using too much of my buying power on this one trade?  If you are then you are going to be far more likely to exit the trade before hitting your profit target just to free up that BP to making another trade.

\- Is my position so large that I will be making decisions based on emotion and not on the chart? If so, you may find yourself leaving a trade too early out of fear, or staying in too long because you don't want to take the loss.

Overall your position size should be based on the your daily goal, the setups you like to trade, and how often those setups come along each day.  If you make 10 trades a day, and your daily goal is $1,000, than you need to make $100 per trade.  However, if your win percentage is 60%, than you need to make $500 per trade ($3,000 in winnings) and lose $500 per loss ($2,000 in losses) = $1,000.  As you can see the higher your win percentage, the less pressure there is on any single trade.   But here is the catch-22 = the lower the amount you are willing to lose, the lower the winning percentage.  Why? Because if you are only willing to lose $100 per trade you would be using very tight stops, which reduces the win rate.

As for stops, the goal should be to get the point where you can use mental stops.  Almost every professional Day Trader I know uses mental stops on their trades.  It allows one to be flexible and truly let the price-action guide your decisions.  However, unless you are an experienced trader it is always recommended to use stops - but make sure they are placed according to the appropriate price that would correspond to a technical breakdown.

Overall your entry and exit should be based on your thesis for the trade, which in turn is based on the technical analysis of the charts.  If you are having difficulty with entries and exits that means you are having difficulties with technical analysis. 

The benefit of trading stocks with Relative Strength/Weakness, with directionally sound daily charts is that even if you do not get the best entry (or exit), you still got the market and the stock correct.  That alone should be enough to secure a profitable trade.
