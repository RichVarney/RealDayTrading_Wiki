**"Cut your losers early"!**

**"Lean on the daily chart and don't get shaken out of a good trade!"**

Well, which is it?  Because it seems pretty damn confusing to me.

How does one know which trade they should hold and which ones they should take the loss on?

Many out there believe that cutting losers quickly is the key to a winning strategy.  *Trade doesn't go their way almost immediately?* Cut. Done.  Almost a zero tolerance for even a mid-sized loss.  As you can imagine they have a low win-rate, but a high profit-factor. Tom Hougaard trades like this.

If you are scalping then this philosophy of quickly cutting losers can make sense - *but* in order for it to work you need a ***trending*** stock and a ***trending*** market. Why? Because - if you are in a ***chop*** situation you will almost always get knocked out of a trade  as it is pretty much guaranteed to go against you at some point (by definition this is what ***chop*** does).  However, the dilemma then becomes - if you have a ***trending*** stock and market, why are you scalping? In a ***trending*** market you can get far more profit from holding the position longer and not scalping. 

It's *almost* a catch-22.  

So what does one do?  For example, on Friday I shorted **BILL** around $100 and within an hour the stock was at $108.  That's was at a 1,000 shares - so I was $8K in the hole.  However, the **BILL** daily chart is bearish, my market thesis is bearish, so I held it.  Two hours later I took a small profit.  Now obviously that is not a good R|R, as I would need a roughly 98% win-rate on that set-up to be profitable - but in this case, by the time I was in profit I did not trust the market enough to continue holding.  It was a bad trade, but it would have been significantly worse if I took the loss.

But first let's start at the heart of the problem here - every now and then you most likely have a ***huge loss***, right?  However, you do not have an equal number of ***huge wins***, do you?  As I have explained in posts on mindset this is due to misplaced emotions.  We tend to ***hope*** our losers turn around, and are ***afraid*** our winners will turn against us.  So we wind up having little faith when we are right, and blind faith when we were clearly wrong.   That is kind of messed up.  

But again, there is that contradiction....aren't we also told that we need to *lean on the daily chart* and *give the trade room to breathe*?  So in a sense aren't we trained to have faith in our losers?  

The entire thing is a psychological mine field that can mess with even the most experience traders.  In fact, this issue would qualify as one of the central most important obstacles facing traders - ***When do you know you should cut your loss and when should you hold?***

In order to address this, we need to look at three potential solutions: 

**1) Balance, 2) Math, 3) Parameters**

Hopefully by the end of this post all three will make sense. 

***Balance:***

Starting with the first one **Balance** \- and no, I do not mean this in the Karate Kid sense where you'll have to go start trimming a bonsai tree as you reach a state of peaceful enlightenment (although I am sure that couldn't hurt).  Instead I am talking about it in the literally meaning of the word - if you are going to have ***faith*** in your losers you need to have ***equal faith*** in your winners.  Let's assume you continue to have the occasional big loss.  I mean it would be great if you could get rid of those glaring reminders of a total lapse in judgement, but let's be honest - you're gonna fuck up again, and you know it.  So let's work on balancing it out instead.

Look at this hypothetical trade, completely fictional but one some of you might relate to:

&#x200B;

[PYPL Short Gone Bad](<img src="cache/images/00d482cd263bd82f70627a4d43b408c9.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

This type of set-up isn't that unusual - you get trapped in a short and then find a million reasons to justify why you should stay in it.  *Excuses like - The market was going up and dragging up PYPL with it, so it is just a matter of waiting for the market to reverse, right? (****btw - you should have been saying to yourself, PYPL has clearly lost its' Relative Weakness to SPY - I should exit****).*  You think about the daily chart and how bearish it is, especially after earnings which gives you even more confidence in the short. But eventually the trade hits your pain tolerance limit - it enters the gap.  

So here is a situation where a trade of 500 shares results in a loss of roughly $1,950.  Now in retrospect a trader in this situation might notice that there was a clear ALGO line on the daily chart descending down from 8/4/22 that provided decent resistance at $75.25 and in fact, PYPL bounced down off that ALGO line. There are countless arguments about whether one should have cut this trade or stayed in it.  You could certainly make the case that by the third green candle you had an HA reversal and that would have been a good time to take the loss.  By the fifth green candle PYPL moved north of VWAP which is another intraday indication that you might want to close the trade.  Conversely there are plenty of arguments for holding this trade overnight as well.   Still, whether it be shares or Puts, a lot of traders would have held this position when they should have cut, and then cut it when they should have held. But like I said, for the moment we're just going to own the fact that shit like this is going to happen. you're going to take these types of losses. The real problem is that there isn't an equally large win on the other side of the ledger to balance it out.

And here is why:

&#x200B;

[CRWD Short that worked?](<img src="cache/images/4977279f6544b14d97b1b56daaca1a76.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

This is the chart for CRWD on Friday and what might have been a typical trade - shorting it at $136.35 and getting out at $135.35, making $1 profit on the trade.  Nice, right! But what if instead of exiting at $136.35 you *added* to this trade instead?  Imagine you started with 250 shares short and then doubled it when you were up $1 and brought you average to $135.85, but now at 500 shares.  Then you could have exited just four candles later at $131.85, making $4 per share profit.  And yes, you could have stayed in and gotten even more as the chart shows, but realistically you probably wouldn't hold during that slight run-up.  So $4 profit with 500 shares would be $2,000 in profit - that profit would have neutralized the loss from the PYPL trade.

All it would have taken would have been to stay in the trade that was working for exactly half the time you remained in a short that was going against you.  In other words if a trader had half the faith in this **CRWD** trade working as they did in the **PYPL** trade turning around they would cancel each other out. It took an hour of watching PYPL go up before most traders would have finally said, "Enough", so surely one can handle watching a trade go in their favor for 30 more minutes? Why is that so hard? Or rather why is it so much easier to watch the loss get bigger than the win?

In terms of fixing the immediate problem you will find it will be much easier to increase your average win size than it will be to eliminate the occasional large loss. 

The next time you are planning to exit a profitable position ask yourself:

\- **Is there a reason to exit other than hitting an arbitrary target? (i.e., there is nothing special about $1 or .50 as a target)**

**- If I wasn't in this trade, would I still enter it now?**

**- Are the conditions from the market and/or the stock the same as they were when I entered the trade?**

If your answers to these questions are: *No, Yes, Yes.* As in, **No** there is no reason to exit, **Yes** if I wasn't in this trade I would enter it now and **Yes** the conditions are the same as when I entered. Then instead of exiting the position, add to it.  You don't need to double the size, but if you have 500 shares than add 250 more, if you have 200 shares than add 100 more.  Every time you want to exit ask yourself those three questions.  

If the answers are *No, Yes, Yes -* ***add ,*** if it is - *No, No, Yes -* ***stay in trade****, any other combination -* ***Exit.***

***Doing this will help you Balance out your tendency towards bigger losses than wins.***

***Math:***

I know....everyone's favorite topic.  But let's see if one can indeed "Math" their way out of this problem.  And do that let's use an example - shorting **AAPL** at $138.11.  Here is the chart with four potential points of resistance.  The first point is at $138.75 and represents the low from Thursday (you can see several touches on this line when you look to the left), the second point is right at the halfway mark up the previous two candles at $140.27, the 3rd point is right before **AAPL** would enter the "gap" at $142.67 (which is also the high from Thursday/Friday, representing somewhat strong resistance), the 4th is the "gap fill" at $145 which is also the low from last Wednesday, and then finally the 5th point of Resistance is the SMA 50 which also connect with the upward sloping ALGO line giving this price point the strongest level of Resistance.  Here's the chart:

&#x200B;

[AAPL Reistance](<img src="cache/images/be38c29b9e1910d140e8965b4bc4224c.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

If you shorted 500 shares of $AAPL at $138.11 and used the 1st point of Resistance as your stop that would be a .64 cent loss, representing -$320. If you used the 2nd point of Resistance (halfway up the candle) as your stop that would be a loss of $2.16, representing -$1,080. If you used the 3rd point of Resistance as your stop that would be a loss of $4.56, representing -$2,280.  The 4th point of $145 is a $6.89 loss, representing $3,445 and finally the 5th point is $149.44 which would be a massive $11.33 loss, representing -$5,665.

Let's say on these shorts you typically have a profit target of 50 cents.  So let's see how often you would need to be right using a 50 cents profit target for you to be profitable, based on each of these Resistance levels.

Using the 1st level of $138.78, which is a .64 loss, you would need to be right **56.15%** of the time in order to break-even on this trade with a target of .50 cents profit.  That certainly doable if you have the market and stock conditions in your favor.

Using the 2nd level of $140.27, which is a $2.16 loss, you would need to be right **81.2%** of the time in order to break-even on this trade with a target of .50 cents profit.  Well, we can stop right here.  Is it reasonable to expect this trade to hit your target of .50 cents profit more than 81.2% of the time?  Not really, no.

So what does this tell us?  ***It tells us that if you want to keep your profit target at 50 cents than you have to use the 1st level of resistance as your stop - otherwise it would not be a successful & repeatable set-up.*** 

But what if we raised our profit target to $1? Then what happens? 

At a $1 profit target - if you kept your stop at the 1st level of Resistance you would only need to be successful more than **39%** of the time to be profitable. 

At the 2nd level of resistance you would need to be successful more than **68.4%** of the time.  If you think about, with the conditions in your favor you would just need **AAPL** to drop $1 instead of going up $2.16 more than 68.4% of the time.  This is not unreasonable and argues for using this higher profit target.

What if you raised your profit target to $2? **AAPL** certainly has room to drop another 2 dollars, so it's not crazy to think you could get this much on a short.  This would be a profit of $1,000 with a position size of 500 shares.

With a $2 profit target if you used the 1st level of resistance as your stop, you would need to be right more than **24.3%** of the time.  If you used the 2nd level of resistance, you would need to be right more than **51.9%** of the time.  And now let's bring in the 3rd level of resistance, which is a loss of $4.56 per share.  In this case, you would need to be correct more than **69.5%** of the time.  

***The higher your profit target the more runway you can give the trade.***

As you can hopefully see from the mathematical exercise above - the issue isn't holding on to your "losers" for too long, but rather having profit targets that are too small.  For example, if you kept your 50 cent profit target but allowed the trade to go all the way to the SMA 50 before taking the loss you would need to have a **95.8%** win-rate just to break-even on that set-up.  Even if you had a $4 profit target you would still need more than a **73.9%** win-rate on this set-up in order to justify letting **AAPL** go all the way to the SMA 50 before saying, "No more...mercy...".  That is just not a reasonable expectation.

And therein lies the mathematical problem - it is not reasonable to expect the win-rates needed in order to justify how long we are letting our losers run.  

**Therefore one either needs to either increase their profit target or decrease their tolerance for a stop.**

And finally we have **Parameters -** 

Because naturally one might ask - "what is considered Reasonable?"  Fair question.  

So let's go back to **AAPL:**

&#x200B;

[AAPL Support](<img src="cache/images/90c245eb1da44beec55c09b35dd2a585.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

So what is a reasonable profit target here for a short on **AAPL**?  Is it $137.06? The low from June 10th that seems to provide some decent horizontal support except under extreme circumstances?  That is roughly $1.05 away from the current price.  In the absence of any extreme circumstance (i.e., huge market drop, company news) this certainly seems obtainable.  With $1.05 profit target one could use the first point of resistance and only need to be right more than **37.9%** of the time to make money.  You could even use the farther away level of Resistance (which would be a potential loss of $2.16) and need to be right more than **67.3%** of the time.  

Have you found a reasonable compromise? It would seem so - A $1.05 profit target using the first point of Resistance gives you the best chance at being profitable as it combines a low percentage of needing to be right (below 50% at 37.9%) with a higher level of profitability ($525 at $1.05 profit).  

**Tying all this together -** 

First off - No you do not need to do all this math before making a trade.  You could of course put together a simple Google Sheet (or Excel) that can calculate everything for you, but overall it is the concept that one needs to embrace.

You need to lean into your winners (use the three questions from above).  You cannot hold on to losers and let them run if you do not also have equally strong profit targets intended for the trade.  And you must know where levels of Resistance and Support are in order to come up with reasonable *parameters*.  If Resistance is $3 away from the current price, that means at 500 shares you are willing to lose $1,500.  Thus any profit target that gives you less than $1,500 means you need to have a higher than 50% win-rate on that set-up.

***Or rather - if you keep letting your losers run you better be making enough money when you win to justify it!***

*But wait....what about leaning on the daily chart? How does that come into it?* 

Simple - you know that whole - win-rate you need in order to be profitable?  Well, the strong the daily chart, the more likely you are to have a higher win-rate.  **Think of the following list for taking a short:**

\- Stock is Relatively Weak Intraday

\- Stock is Relatively Weak on the Daily Chart

\- Market is Bearish

\- Stock has a weak Daily Chart (below SMA's, downward trend)

\- Stock broke compression to the downside on the Daily Chart

\- Stock has high Relative Volume

**The more of these that are checked off - the higher your win-rate will become.**  

**Are each equally as important? No....but that is for another post.**

Best, H.S.
