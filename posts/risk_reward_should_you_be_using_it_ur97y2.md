New traders ***love*** to talk about **Risk-Reward** ratios.  And I get it - it is simple and on the surface, it makes sense.  

In Poker, players look at something called **Pot Odds**.  For example, if there is $200 in the pot and the Bet comes to you at $50, you are putting in $50 to win $200, a 4 to 1 return.  However, that only makes sense for you if your hand can win more than 20% of the time.   So let's say you have two pair on the flop and you know your opponent has a Flush.  So the only chance you have of winning is if you either get a full house or Four of a kind.  If you play enough you know your odds of that full-house hitting by the river card is roughly 17%, which is lower than the 20% you need for the bet to worth it.  So you fold.

However, there is also something called **Implied Pot Odds.**  In the example above let's also say your opponent has about $1,000 in chips behind them and they have been an aggressive player all night.  You know that if you hit your full-house and go all-in, they will call with their flush.   So you **Implied Odds** changes your calculation because you know that on the 17% of the time you hit your hand, you will be able to get that $1,000 as well.

There is some subjectivity to these calculations because you need to guess at the chance is you will win the hand if you hit your card, which means you are guessing at what your opponent has or whether you can get them to fold.  But there no subjectivity to the odds of getting the card you need, that is an absolute, and easy to figure out.  

But now let's look at a stock - let's say you went long on **OXY** at $68 - and you got 500 shares, costing you $34,000.   Off the bat, let's be clear - **you are not risking $34,000**.  You are only risking the amount you are willing to lose on the trade.

The high of the previous day is $64.50, which would be a stop, either mental or hard, $3.50 below your entry - a pretty steep drop.  However, VWAP is $66.87, so you decide to put your stop at $66.50 (to give it some room), which is $1.50 below your entry.   Sounds fairly reasonable. So does that mean you need to put your target at $69.50 to at least make it a 1 to 1 Risk-Reward?  

Well that would only make sense if you believe there is a 50% of either event occurring.  What if I had my target at $68.50 which is 50 cents above my entry, and my stop at $66.50, meaning I am aiming to win .50 cents and willing to lose $1.50 - that seems like a bad play, right?

Let's say you made that play and walked away, and 75% you hit your target - 25% of the time you hit your stop - what would happen? You would break-even.  So now, all you need to know is if you have better than a 75% chance of hitting your target.  If you do, than the play is worth it.  

But wait - if you feel have a 75% of hitting your target, why not just place the stop closer?  That way you would lose less during the 25% of the time it is triggered.  Because, the closer your stop gets to your entry, the lower the chance you have of hitting your target before hitting your stop.   Another way to think about it is to just expand it out to the extremes - if you entered at $68 and your stop was $67.99, it would probably trigger around 99% of the time.  If it was $67.95, it would probably trigger around 98% of the time, and so on.  Conversely, the chance that OXY goes up another 50 cents is significantly higher than it going up another $1 on the day, and certainly a higher likelihood of it going up another $1.50.  So the higher your target is, the lower your chance of hitting it.

Now in poker, you have the benefit of playing against the players for a length of time and a good player will be able to recognize their betting patterns, their tells, etc.  So you can make an educated guess about what type of hand they may be holding (and thus, what hand you would need to beat them).  But in trading you do not have that benefit - what you do have is the history of the stock, the current market, and the history of the set-up you are using to enter the trade.

As a full-time trader I have a pretty good sense of what my chance of success is entering a stock that just broke through ALGO resistance, with heavy volume, having Relative Strength against the market on a day where the sector is hot.  I also have a decent read on the market and whether or not it will reverse, and if it does how much that might impact the stock I am trading.  I also know the stock and what the rough chance is of **OXY** pushing up another 50 cents compared to another $1 or $1.50.  Particularly since it has been slowly drifting up all day, so for it to hit $69.50 it would need a fairly bullish run in the last few hours - which is unlikely given the stock's history. All of those things combined will give me a decent sense of what my mental stop should be on that trade, or even if the daily chart indicates the possibility of swinging it to the next day.

However, a newer trader knows none of these things - they have not traded a set-up thousands of times, journaled them and calculated the likelihood of it working.  They have little experience in being able to predict the whether or not SPY will reverse, or if intra-day sector rotation will occur.

***In other words -***  unless you are an experienced trader you have very little idea of what your risk-reward might be and how to use it in figuring out your stops.  ***Which is why you shouldn't do it.***

***Instead you have something else - you have technical indicators that tell you whether your thesis is still valid and that is what you should be using.***

You do not need years of experience to calculate Relative Strength to the market or sector, or to note the volume levels.  You do not years of experience to see a break of Resistance and whether the stock fell back below it.  ***This is what should tell you when to exit, not Risk-Reward***. 

And let's all tell the truth here, what "**Risk-Reward**" really winds up meaning is that you are watching your **P&L** and seeing how much you are down.  **OXY** drops $1 and all you are looking at is that you are now down $500 and you don't want to lose more.  All the math goes out the window and you are just freaking out thinking how this one trade wiped out all your gains on the day.

And here's the kicker - by the time you become experienced enough, you are not using **Risk-Reward** at all, even though you are far more equipped to do it.  Why? Because let's say in that **OXY** trade it dropped to $66, and I am down $2 on the trade.  Now I ask myself - based on the daily chart, the sector, and the market, what is the chance that **OXY** will not only recover the $2 it lost, but get to my target if I swing the stock?  If I feel the dip was temporary, or news-related, I might hold it.  If I saw that the sector was still strong but only **OXY** was dropping I might close the trade.  At that point I am making my decision based on a Yes-No scenario - will it recover for a break-even or profit?  If I think it will, I do not close the trade. 

Notice how it is now down to a 1 or 0 choice? Will it or won't it?  Yes or no?  

I also know based on the technical chart that unless it can get back over that line of Resistance, I won't swing the stock.  Again, a **yes** or **no** decision. 

Why would I let it drop $2 and go below resistance? Because simply breaching resistance is not confirmation.  Perhaps the market dropped during that time and **OXY** dropped proportionally less than **SPY** did?  In that case I would want to see how **OXY** reacts to any market bounce and if it can close above $66.50.

**Risk-Reward** makes sense when you are doing Option Spreads - or Butterflies.  For example, if I am doing an Out-of-the-Money Put Credit Spread, and I get a $1 Credit for a $5 distance between the strikes, I know I am getting a 25% ROI on my money and I need to win that trade more than 80% of the time.  The more credit I receive the closer to the money my short-strike needs to be and thus the lower my odds of winning.  It also makes sense with a Butterfly if I pay $2 for a 330/350/370 Butterfly, I am getting 10 to 1 on my money.  My max win is $20 and my max loss in $2.  I only need to win 10% of the time. Do I feel that there is a 10% chance of the stock hitting $350 on expiration?   In those cases Risk/Reward informs me exactly how much I am either willing to receive in credit or pay in a debit.  I won't take less than 20 cents per every dollar between strikes for an OTM Bullish Put Spread that has at least 2 layers of support above the short strike.  Why do I know this? Because out of over 500 OTM BPS' I know exactly what the projected win-rate would be if the set-up is correct.  

So the next time you think about **Risk-Reward** consider this post and then stop fooling yourself that you are doing a statistical calculation when you don't even know the probability of either event occurring. Realize you are actually just trading your **P&L** which is exactly what you shouldn't be doing and start trading the chart instead.

*Keep in mind I am 84% sure this philosophy is correct, but that is only the case half the time.*

Best, H.S.
