I'm getting a ton of messages asking if I'm using the same scanners which got me wondering why that is. So I tried to put myself in their shoes and imagine why scanners would be my primary focus and I think I might have an idea.

First of all I'm not a pro trader but I'm doing pretty well. There's still going to be mistakes and speedbumps on the way but one mindset issue is one that I believe I've conquered and that's scarcity and urgency.

The idea that there are only a small amount of chances per day and if you miss them then you'll never be profitable. Or the idea that the market is so terrible these days that it's impossible to be a winning trader. I think neither is true

/u/Hanshanot turned 500$ into 30k+ in a season by taking on average less than 1 trade per day. How many trades do you think Han's scanners showed him during that?

Chances are that if you could replay the day back and scan with a fine toothed comb there's likely 20 or even 30 good opportunities per day, if not more. The market every day is absolutely packed with opportunities. No trader can catch them all but I promise you that there's nothing magical about a scanner that will solve this issue for you.

You have a scarcity and urgency based mindset that is causing you to have a terrible emotional connection with the market and tickers. That's why you feel like you aren't catching *any* opportunities

You'll rush into SMA breaks (like INTC yesterday I bet) or hold on to a trade that's obviously a mistake (I could have done with SRE) or just pounce on anything that looks good because you are afraid of being left behind.

Emotionally you feel like the world of wealth and success has left you behind and so you aren't going to let that happen this time but the irony is that's the *exact* feeling that will guarantee you never get there.

This is the magical principle:
