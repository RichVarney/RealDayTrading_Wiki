I wrote a ThinkorSwim script that highlights high volume candles in "Lime" or "Red" respsectiively to their original color to make it a little easier to identify algo lines, for those that are trying to do this.  Enjoy

Bonus: Here is attempt at running an algo line for AMZN, I am new to this algo stuff so this algo line might be complete bullshit, but it saves a lot of time to not have to look down at the volume a million times when trying to chart out the high volume candles.
