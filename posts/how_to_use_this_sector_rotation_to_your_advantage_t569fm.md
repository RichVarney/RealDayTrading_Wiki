We all know the market is volatile right now and we all know why - there is no reason to rehash it.  

However, there is also a somewhat rare phenomena occurring - *a severe imbalance across sectors*.  Typically when the market is up, some sectors are stronger than others, but on the whole, it is atypical to find an entire sector in the red when the market itself is bullish.  Conversely, when the market is down, it is equally unusual to see an entire sector showing increases overall.

Right now we are seeing several sectors that are *extremely bullish -* ***Industrials, Basic Materials, Energy.***  And also witnessing other sectors-indexes that is showing extreme weakness - ***Technology - Gaming, Technology - Health Information Services, Consumer Cyclical - Auto Manufactures, etc.*** .

Within each of these bullish sectors/indexes you will see stocks that have great *Relative Strength*, just as you will find stocks with really good levels of *Relative Weakness*. 

This allows you to not only build a balanced short-term trading portfolio, but also one that is protected.  If **SPY** continues up, your shorts should continue to head into profit due to the corresponding sector/index weakness, and the reverse applies as well. 

Here is the sector breakdown, and their proportional contribution to the S&P 500: 

* Information technology - 28.7%
* Healthcare - 13.1%
* Consumer Discretionary - 12%
* Financials - 11.3%
* Communication Services - 10%
* Industrials - 7.8%
* Consumer Staples - 6.1%
* Energy - 3.4%
* Real Estate - 2.7%
* Materials - 2.5%
* Utilities - 2.5%

And within each are the Indexes - for example, in **Technology** while *Data-Storage* is up today, *Electronic Gaming* is way down.

Take advantage of this disparity and create a combination of positions that leave you not only protected, but highly profitable.

Best,

H.S.
