No matter what **SPY** does, somebody is going to be unhappy.  It goes up and *Bears* complain*,* it goes down and *Bulls* are sad.  It must be tough being **SPY**.   But does **SPY** care? Hell, no.  It just does its' thing, knowing that while you might love it today, you're probably going to be cursing it tomorrow.    It's gotta wear on the poor bastard, don't you think?  

Either way, our job is to read the story **SPY** is telling us - and in doing so, we form our *thesis.*

So here is my thesis on **SPY** as it currently stands - and I do not think this particular story has a happy ending.

&#x200B;

[The Story of SPY](<img src="cache/images/3a5d65b7718ffa162f123ef170bd94cd.png" alt="Reddit Image">)

To begin with you can see that **SPY** is pretty much at a decision point and it is going to have to make up its' mind....fast. 

The current price of $427.83 is resting right on the upward sloping trend from 7/14.  How strong is that support? Well it hasn't broken it in over a month.  In fact, if you create the upward sloping channel (drawing the top end starting at 7/8) you will see that the market has gone up roughly 14% during that time.

Right above the current price is both the SMA 200 ($431.24) and Horizontal Resistance ($429.50), levels that the market hasn't surpassed since April.

However, with the exception of one day (7/29), this entire rally has taken place on days with below average volume.  Ah, but it is the summer you say? Volume is generally lower, right?  Then why was there 15 days of above average volume during the same period in 2020? And why was the volume in August 2019 almost double what it is now?   Huh? What about that?? Yeah, that's what I thought!  

Not only has the volume been crap - **but** the *ATR* of **SPY** declined almost 50%!  That means tiny-ass candles - and that is exactly what we got - tiny ass, low volume candles.  And don't give me the whole, "but it is Summer!" garbage - because if I go back to previous summers that ass is most definitely bigger.  In fact, there are some big ass high volume candles in the previous summers.  So much for the "Tiny-ass is normal during the summer" theory!

But wait, there's more.....the OBV is has been declining.  How can that be?  How can **SPY** be going up, while the On-Balance Volume is going down?  Because ***that*** is a **divergence**.  And not the Shailene Woodley teen flick that I know you all watched and loved - nope....this is technical divergence.  What does it mean?  It means that when those tiny-ass candles were green, volume wasn't just low, it was *super low*.  

So now we have **SPY**, two significant levels of Resistance above it, currently sitting on Support and nary $1.61 between the two.  In other words - ***it's trapped.  Torn asunder. At a fork in the road.*** 

Without a catalyst to push it forward, the poor thing only has one way to go....right where the *divergence* says it will - ***down*****.**  

**Will it have volume when it finally drops?** Hell yeah it will.  

**But when? When will this awful thing happen??** End of August - Jackson Hole Economic Conference - where *Cool meets Cash*.

So expect some chop, tight ranges, and low volume for a few more days and then when a bunch of old white men that are just bursting with charisma meet on 8/25-8/27, **the selling will begin**.  

Anyway, that's my thesis - who the hell knows?

 

Best, H.S.
