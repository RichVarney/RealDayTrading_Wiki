Following u/Glst0rm [sharing his personal TV layouts and Indicators](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/ypao5a/sharing_my_tradingview_layouts_for_realdaytrading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I asked a few of the mods if creating a repository of traders’ layouts and indicators would be useful for the community and they liked the idea.  Our Wiki Master u/--SubZer0-- agreed to set a section aside in the Wiki for anyone that is willing to share their layouts with the community.

My charts are pretty simple compared to others´.  Í´ve been on a mission lately to  simplify my trading, both in number of trades I take, charts and indicators I use, etc.  My trading has gone like the traditional meme bell curve: from Simple because I don’t know any better, to really complex, trading BBflys, legging in and out, complex options, indicators, lines, 10 simultaneous positions, shorts and longs, to again very simple shares only and slimmed down indicators and screens.  The difference in just overall PnL stability has been staggering as I’ve simplified.

Anyway rant over, here are my layouts. I hope they help. If you are willing to share yours, please do!

My screen always looks like this:

[Layout with ‘Research’ tab open](<img src="cache/images/300f0ee53951a84e4b9fedc6713d4567.jpg" alt="Reddit Image">)

I have 3 windows:

1. Wing 1 to the left has IWM, TICK, QQQ, UVXY, TLT and VIX.  Content rarely changes
2. Wing 2 far right has the major sectors. Content rarely changes
3. Middle window has two principal tabs: Main and Research

The center window has several tabs: to the left always my ’Main’ tab with SPY, /ES and 6 of my main tickers on watch and/or open trades (image below).  To the right of that primary tab I have my research tabs with the ‘Research’ Layout, split into weak and strong stocks that I’m looking at throughout the day. I use the ‘Research’ layout to quickly flip through charts during the session.  The top ones make it into a watch list and into my ‘Main’ tab.  I further divide my chart flipping between Research tabs for strong and weak tickers, each with their ‘weak’ or ‘strong’ watchlist ready so that I don’t have to pull up a new watchlist every time.   Keeps it organized and I can flip through tons of charts pretty fast.
