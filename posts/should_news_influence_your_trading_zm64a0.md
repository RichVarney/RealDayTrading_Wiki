As many of you know, I have been knocked out of commission recently.  While I hope to return to trading soon (going a bit stir crazy actually), my amazing wife is doing a phenomenal job of taking over while I am laid up.    Hopefully at some point it will no longer feel like there is jackhammer going off inside my head and I will be back in action.   Still, since I can't sit still, I figured I would jump into a debate. 

Looking through the past few days I noticed a very interesting discussion was had in the OneOption chat room. Even though I was unable to participate then, I figured I would write up my thoughts now.

**The question posed was fairly straightforward -** ***How much should we, as traders, take the news into account when making decisions?*** 

*Thoughts on the matter range from;*  
**“Not at all - only the price action matters” to “A lot - the ‘Why’ matters just as much as the ‘What’”.**

And for the sake of this discussion lets qualify news as actual "news", not what some talking head is saying, or what is currently getting buzz on social media.  I am referring to actual news releases that have a material impact on the market or a stock.

From the perspective of a *Chart Purist* the resulting Price Action is all you need to know in order to make the right decisions. In a way, you could theoretically not know the name of the stock, and just look at the candles. This position has a lot of merit. As traders our job is a constant undertaking in trying to isolate Institutional buying/selling in order to “Follow the smart money”.  That can be difficult to do when you take the catalyst for a price move into account as you invariably also introduce your own bias into the analysis.  

As a quick aside, there is a parallel to this in my past life when I was predicting opening weekend Box-Office on a film.  I would always have the data in front me (what % of moviegoers were aware of the title, what % were interested in seeing it, and what % made it their top choice), broken down by demographics and every other category you can imagine.  I would also have the results of the prediction model as well.  But in the end, the actual prediction - the number that would go out to the world (i.e., when you see a headline that says, "**Black Panther** beat expectations!" - those expectations come from that prediction) would be my decision.  I could choose to go with the model and the data, or I could also ignore it and put out what I felt would be the result.   The issue was - *knowing what the movie was always influenced the decision.*  The data might say one thing, but looking at the title I might think, "There is no way that **Batman** is only going to open to $70 million!"  I actually explored this and had people on the team make the predictions without knowing the title and when the title is revealed.  It turns out, as expected, that the more experience someone has, the better they were able to improve on the model when they knew the title.  However, those with less experience would invariably fuck it up when the knew what movie they were predicting. 

Anyway, back to stocks - now we have all seen stock prices (or the market in general) move in the opposite direction we would assume given the news. Whether it is a stock tanking on good earnings or the market going up after a hot CPI number - at one point, every single one of us has watched the price action, and said, “What the fuck??” 

*That is our bias at play and it can negatively impact our decisions.* Whereas if we had ignored the news and simply watched the Price Action our trades would be based solely on what we see in front of us.

But is it as simple as that? Just look at the chart? 

To answer that question, let’s examine this from a few angles. To begin with we need to start with a very basic premise - When we are trading off Price Action, we aren’t trading where a stock is at that moment, *but rather where we think it will go after the trade goes through.* If we see a stock dropping and we short it, we are shorting it because we believe it will continue to go down. *I think we can all agree on this idea, yes?*

So if our trades are based on some prognostication of where the price will go, the next question is that of timeframe. By definition, as traders we are looking at a significantly lower timeframes than someone investing in the company. An investor needs to take Fundamentals into account, as well as a macro-level thesis on the market overall. Clearly for anyone investing, the “news” could be very significant. 

Traders on the other hand are looking at much lower timeframes. We want to know where the stock might go from the next minute to the next couple of weeks, but certainly no longer. Therefore we can further narrow things down by saying that when a trader is looking at a chart they are trying to predict the direction (**and magnitude, which is key**) of the move over the more immediate future. Again, I assume we can all agree on this as well?

In order to do this, we use Technical, rather than Fundamental analysis. Does it really matter what **Pepsi’s** P/E ratio is if we are buying it at 9am and selling it at 11am on the same day? Of course not.  Although here arises the one major drawback with Technical Analysis that we have all experienced:

One of the most important questions to answer when trading of - ***When do you exit? When do you hold?***  

Sure technical analysis can inform this decision, but when you are short a stock at $141.34 and it pops up to $142.45 - the question of *Should I hold? Should I exit?* becomes of paramount importance. That pop may be temporary, it could be because of the market, or it could be quite real and continue. For example, right now I am long **MRNA**, but in the last thirty minutes of the day **MRNA** dropped $5 - is that real? Is that profit taking? 

And for this, traders look at *context*.  That context may be the Daily Chart, which is not *live price action* but rather historical information.  It is also the market itself to see if you are trading with the trend, how strong that trend may be and of course, how strong/weak the stock is relative to **SPY**.  

In a sense, *all of this* is context that goes outside the immediate price action of the ticker. 

The reason that *context* is applicable to your analysis is due to its *objective* nature.  There is widespread agreement on what a *bullish* daily chart or *bearish* daily chart looks like. It should also be noted that while the quality of one's interpretation still lies in part with their level of expertise, even a rudimentary level of knowledge would get the overall gist correct.  Or to put another way, even a dumbass can look at a chart and see whether it looks good or bad.

Now let's look at the larger issue at hand - *External Stimuli*, typically - **news**.  Before we go into the difficulty of being able to accurately predict the impact a piece of news will have, let's look briefly at the issues that can arise even if you get it *right*.

Let's say a piece news drops - e.g. *Apple is revising its forward guidance down.*  Off that news you are confident that **AAPL** is going to drop, and sure enough there is a huge red bar.  So you enter the short.  But here is what you *don't know -* ***What is the magnitude of the impact*****?**  Will that revised guidance absolutely crush **AAPL,** allowing you to ride that short all the way down? Or will it bounce? You have no fucking clue - and if you become too convinced of the bearish result, you might ignore obvious signs that it has found support and is reversing.

**News** reports, if one were to use them to provide context in their trading, need to be broken out into two categories:

**- Strength -** Here one is not only looking at the *magnitude* of the impact, but also whether the news is strong enough to bypass levels of *Support/Resistance*.  For example, we know that a **Fed Announcement (e.g., FOMC)** can have an oversized move on the entire market and also have the strength to break through major levels of S/R.   However, we have also seen those announcement wind up have a very tame impact overall.  Still - in terms of *potential*, this type of news has the potential to render your *Technical Analysis* useless.

**- Objectivity  -** Of equal importance is how confidently one can interpret the news and its resulting impact on the stock/market.  

Here is an example where knowing the news might lead you to a better choice than being blind of the reason- let's say you are *Short AMZN* \- you shorted the stock at $92.40 and are currently in profit (it is at $91.64).  All of a sudden there is a substantial green bar that takes the price up to your entry.  

*If you had no knowledge of why it was going up*  \- since the stock did not break through any line of resistance, and this was just one 5-minute candle, you would most likely hold (one cannot exit positions because of one or two 5-min candles).

*If you knew it was going up because it released revised guidance that was positive* \- knowing this, you might exit that short at break-even as the stock now has a catalyst to go higher, with a lot of room until major Resistance ($101).

Knowing the news allowed you to exit sooner than you might have if you waited for technical confirmation.

As mentioned earlier the use of **news** to someone that is *trading* (i.e., not investing) is in its ability to give you more context so you can better predict if a move in the price will continue.  Price action alone will show you what the stock is doing, but we all know that the trick to being profitable is to know when to get out, when to hold and when to double down (*and the best you can hope for is to die in your sleep - Kenny Rogers*)  We also know that the charts are constantly filled with *noise* that can either shake us out of good positions or give us false confidence. Knowing whether or not a move is *real* is essential to being a successful trader.

Going back to those categories let's first dig a bit deeper into each.  Under **Strength** we can break that tag into the following by how bound the price remains to technical levels:

**Extremely Strong -** This type of news can cause a stock (or the market) to ignore all levels of *Support* or *Resistance.*  Thus, even a moving average that has been tested many times can be rendered toothless by this type of release.  An extreme earnings report might fall into this category.  This can also have a lasting effect on the price.

**Strong -** This will move the stock/market outside its typical ATR and may even breakthrough minor levels of S/R (i.e. basic horizontal resistance), but it doesn't result in enough volume or intensity to break any major barriers.  It may push price further in any direction but that result will most likely be temporary. A product update qualifies here (unless it is major).

**Moderate -** These are your temporary boosts (or drops) to a price that tend to quickly fade.  An afterhours *Insider Buy* might jump a $10 stock to $12 really fast, but then anyone trying to get in at that level might quickly find themselves trapped.

The other category of **Objectivity** is far more difficult to break down.  To begin with one must differentiate between *Expected* and *Unexpected* news.  If news is *Expected* on a stock (e.g., upcoming earnings), Market Makers will take that news into account and price the options accordingly.  That means as traders we are really trading *against the MM's*.  Our bet here is that they got the potential range incorrect.  It is important to keep in mind here that the *MM*'s have an immense amount of resources at their disposal and their models tend to be extremely accurate.  For example, if **Stock A** is worth $100 and they have earnings that evening, the $100 Call might go for $3.50 which is primarily due to the higher IV.  Therefore, you need to not only get the direction correct, but also have the stock *exceed* the projected range the *MM*'s assigned to it.

It goes even deeper than that - stock may be at $100, but that may be because investors anticipated a strong earnings report and were already pricing that in.  The current price level may very well be due to well over a month of investor activity that increased the price of the stock due to anticipation of good news. Hence when the news finally drops, the price goes down.   

*Unexpected news* is a very different story, as that information was *not* priced in.  However, due to its *unexpected* nature it also means that the interpretation of how it will impact the stock and by how much, rests entirely on you - the trader. 

This gives us the following:

**Fully Objective** \- This is very rare.  A piece of news that has a clear and predictable impact on either the market or a stock. The key part of this is that the news *must* be *unexpected*.  Here is an exaggerated example of what this type of news might look like: "**Shocking new data reveals that iPhone use causes cancer!"** (and that the news comes from a reputable source).  As outrageous as that sounds (as well as impossible), news like that would definitely indicate a drop for **AAPL**.   What you wouldn't know is by how much.   Obviously if you were Long **AAPL** and saw this news you would close your position.  If you were short **AAPL** you might even decide to double down.  As stated earlier, this shit doesn't happen very often and usually by the time you see it, it may well be too late.  Would you enter the short here?  What if **AAPL** dropped from $143.37 down $138.40 in one candle, breaking support.   You might decide to enter a short position here whether you knew the news or not - just based off the chart.  But if you *knew* the reason, would you enter with a larger position than normal? You might - and it would be fairly well justified.  

**Somewhat Objective -** Sticking with **AAPL** (because why not), imagine that there was an internal leak, which is very rare for that company, which showed that the **Apple Car** is much further along than previously thought.  As a result, **AAPL** stock jumps up $149 in one candle, breaking through the SMA 50 and the downward sloping Algo Resistance line.  However, you have the SMA 100 and SMA 200 right ahead at $152 and $153 respectively.  Is this news strong enough to break through those?  This is where it goes into a grey area.   If you did not know the reason behind the jump you might place an alert at $153 and wait it out.  If you did know the reason you might interpret the initial response as being extremely positive, and jump into a long position assuming that the news is strong enough to breakthrough.  However, this may well be the wrong choice and many times it is.

And so on and so on....you can figure out what the remaining groupings would be here. 

As you can see it isn't entirely black and white.  Chart purists have a point, as clearly there are many pitfalls in trying to figure out what impact the news will have on a stock/market.  Many times you can let what you *think* the impact should be cloud your judgement.  News that looks very positive may cause you to get bullish on a position only to find out (because you fucked around) that it was already priced in.  Sometimes that jump in price is due to a bunch of retail traders jumping in, and then finding there is no Institutional support behind their enthusiasm.  All that happened was you gave Institutions a great place to go short.

However, there are other times when knowing the driver of a move can correctly influence your decision in exiting a position, or opening a new trade, a decision you might not have made if you were just looking at the chart alone.

In my experience inexperienced traders have a very difficult time with the concepts of something being "priced in".  Whether it is from their own convoluted theory (e.g., "Consumer debt is rising and soon people will begin to default on their credit card payments causing a crisis for those lenders - I am going enter into Puts on **V** and **AXP**!" - as if the current prices of those assets do not already take the likelihood of that occurring into account), or straight out misinterpretation (e.g., **"Tesla** broke a sales record in Asia for the fourth quarter, and the stock is going up, I am taking Calls on it!" only to find out that even though they broke the record they were expected to break it by even more than they did, and the price quickly reverses).   New traders tend to think in very linear ways - if earnings are good, the price should go up, if a product tanks the price should go down, etc.  And of course the stock market doesn't exactly work that way.

Thus, unless it is one of those rare **Fully Objective Extremely Strong** and *Unexpected* news releases - most traders are better off focusing on the charts themselves. Which isn't to say that one should never take the news into account, but rather every trader needs to be aware of their own shortcomings in this area.  Basically, if you tend to fuck it up more often than not, then do not use the news to influence your decisions.  However, if you are able to correctly integrate it into your analysis as context, then it can obviously be an asset.  

Like everything else, experience matters here.  Ok, now I am going to actually lie back down...maybe.

Best, H.S.
