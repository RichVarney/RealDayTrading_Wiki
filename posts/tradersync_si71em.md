Hey all - as you might remember in my post about "What I spend money on" I recommend getting a subscription to a trading journal over anything else.  Before spending money on a community, books, charting software, you need to a good online trading journal (i.e. not just using Excel).

There are plenty of good journals, and I happen to use TraderSync - because I have been using them, and in particular using them in the challenges, they have agreed to:

A) Build out a function that allows one to show more than one public profile.  This way I won't have to take down the results of one challenge when I want to put up another.  They are building this because of us, which is great.

B) Since they know I recommend it, they gave me this link:  

[https://www.tradersync.com/?ref=realdaytrading](https://www.tradersync.com/?ref=realdaytrading)

Which gives you 50% for as long as you use it, and access to a bunch of educational material. 

It is an *affiliate* link, nothing I can do about that, although I assure you any money that comes in from that I will make sure gets used to build/create services for you, like I said, I don't need the money - they just do not have any other way to do the link. 

And on that note - I (and u/professor1970) have been teasing that something big will be coming soon for all of you (and before you think it, what we are planning would be absolutely free to Traders) and TraderSync loved the concept so much they have agreed to partner with us on it.  So that is going to be a big boost for what we are building!

Best, H.S.
