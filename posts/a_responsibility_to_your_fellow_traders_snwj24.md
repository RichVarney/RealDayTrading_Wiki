You are all after the same thing - *financial independence*.  Just about every single one of you realizes that nobody ever got rich from a full-time job and if you are lucky, you get enough (and many times not even that) to survive.  

So when people enter the world of trading, striving for that better life, every dollar they lose is usually a dollar they couldn't afford to give away.  

What they need to realize is:

*Reaching the goal of being consistently profitable is hard, and it takes time, effort and dedication.*

Still as to be expected, millions of people just jump right in anyway.  And why not? Brokers have made it very easy, so there is little barrier to entry - just deposit money and off you go.  But as we all know, millions of people lose that money, and then lose the next deposit and the next and so on....

So when you see someone post questions or their trades and it is clear they haven't put in the time and work to learn this, every single one of us has a responsibility to reply with - 

***Stop Trading Right Now.***

*They should not spend another dime.*  

Only after they have gotten a solid grasp on the information and methods should they start using their hard-earned cash.  ***And then only with 1 share and 1 Contract at a time.***

I know everyone wants to be helpful and answer these questions (e.g. "Is shorting a good thing?", "I want to try Options, where should I start?", etc.) but the best answer is the one they won't like - ***Stop Trading.***

***Because they WILL lose their money.***  

So I call on all of you to help pull these people pull back from the edge, and make them realize they can't just rush off to war, they need to go to boot camp first.

Best, H.S.
