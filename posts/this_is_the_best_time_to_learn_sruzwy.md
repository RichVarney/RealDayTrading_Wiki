Nobody likes hearing that it takes roughly two years to learn how to trade and be consistently profitable.  Especially when they are further told that means two years of *studying, practice and dedication.*  Meaning, the less time you put it into the longer your journey towards becoming a full-time.  

I always use the analogy of *chess* (or poker) - where it takes a very short amount of time to learn the rules, but *years* to master the game.  

However, right now an amazing opportunity is presenting itself to new traders - ***the market's volatility***.

It is relatively easy to learn when you have a string of one Bullish day after another, especially if you are swing trading.  When it is rare that the market has consecutive days in the red, and stocks that gap up tend to continue increasing throughout the day without any fear of the rug being pulled out, is a bit like learning how to hit when someone is pitching underhand to you.  

Now, obviously I am over-simplifying a bit, but there is no doubt that learning how to trade during a massive bullish run, even when dealing with intra-day trends is playing the game on easy mode.  

But now you have volatility.  **SPY** is unpredictable and experiencing huge swings.  We have seen complete reversals during the day, and an increased sensitivity towards external events.  

This is evident in the $5K Challenge, in which there is a multitude of trading methods, techniques and strategies being employed to just stay ahead of the market.  And that is *exactly what you need*.

If you have followed the advice in the Wiki and done everything to get to the point where you can now trade 1 share and 1 option contract, then this is the perfect time to practice.   And I know that we have constantly emphasized the importance of *win-rate*, but right now, your focus should be on learning how to: 

\- *Balance your portfolio when you have no bias*

\- *Hedge when you do have a bias*

As well as:

\- *Utilize methods that offer protections (e.g. CDS'/PDS'), high return on lower risk (e.g. Butterflies, Spec Plays), Sector Analysis (e.g. Energy/Oil), legging out of spreads (i.e. buying back the short side), timing your exits (i.e. do you take profits early, increase your position or hold), etc.*  

Most importantly, it is the perfect time to really take a deep dive into the Walk-Away Analysis and see where your strengths/weaknesses lie.  

We may not have this opportunity in a month or two from now, so I hope you are all taking advantage of it the best you can.  And if you can't trade with real money, you should at least be paper trading this current environment.

Nothing reduces that two year timeline more than the experience this current market can give you.

See you all out there tomorrow!

 

Best, H.S.
