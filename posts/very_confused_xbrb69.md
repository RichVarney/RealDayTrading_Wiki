Reading many of the posts and comments it is clear that a lot of people had a rough week.  Here is what I don't understand, so perhaps someone can help explain it to me - 

Traders that *are not consistently profitable* were given very explicit rules, rules that I myself wrote a long time ago, and reiterated various times throughout last week - those rules were:

**- Don't short when the market is up**

**- Don't go long when the market is down**

**- Don't short a stock that is green for the day**

**- Don't go long on a stock that is red for the day**

These rules are for those that are struggling, obviously not for those that have already become successful.  Will you miss some good trades following this? Yes - but you will avoid many more bad ones.  They are simple rules for a reason - they are hard to break if you just follow them to the letter.  

In addition to those rules, it is also said at least once a week in this sub that until you reach set benchmarks (outlined in the Wiki) that you should be either *paper-trading or trading one share -* I know for a fact that many of you have *not* reached those benchmarks.

Did I have a Bearish thesis? Yes - in fact, I still do and I am still holding my shorts. If the downward trendline is violated and closed to the upside I will reconsider that thesis. Three bullish days does not counter a Bear Market.  In fact, as Bear Market rallies go, this one is rather wimpy.

However, throughout the week I still had several Long Day Trades, and I noted that my Bearish trades were primarily long term, pointing out that there were either in Short Stock or Long Term Put Leaps - 

So am I to understand that right now people are upset because they *A) Shorted stocks when the market was up, and B) used positions larger than 1 share??* 

If you followed the rules, and the commentary - all indications were that [**SPY**](https://app.oneoption.com/option-stalker/chart/SPY) was bouncing - so simply following - **Do not short when the market is up -** should have saved you from making any mistakes.  But even if you ignored that rule, then simply following - **Paper trade or trade one share until you hit the benchmarks**, should have saved you from any real pain.  

But instead here is what happened - "Hari is super Bearish - I am going all-in on Puts!"  And it seems many of you went all-in on Put that expired ***the same week!*** So even if you ignored all the other rules, if you had followed the clear guidelines to make sure your options are more than a week out - you would have been able to either salvage or keep many of those positions.

So I am curious, and please someone explain it to me - where exactly is the breakdown in communication here?
