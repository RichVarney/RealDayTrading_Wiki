This is the criteria I've been using and so far analyzing my best trades out of 500+ it's working really nicely.

Trading this way is NOT as exciting. You will sit around a lot. you will pass up a *lot* of good trades that win. But your loss rate will absolutely plummet. You'll take 1-5 trades per day probably.

I took 23 trades only last week, maybe could have taken 30 in hindsight.

3 those trades *didn't* follow the criteria in hindsight and guess what: **Only those 3 trades were losing trades.** *Every single trade* I took that followed these criteria was a winner that netted at least a 1% move, most of which went significantly more.

***Every. single. one.***

**MARKET TIMING**

First, you obviously need market confirmation. I didn't take any trades before 10:45am. sometimes even 1200pm because I wanted clear confirmation. Take only trades in the same direction as the market. If the market is kinda choppy/going nowhere, get confirmation that it's doing it and your trades will be even easier to spot against it. WAIT. Good trades happen all day long and you will NOT miss out.

**NEED ALL OF THESE**

**Daily Chart Quality** \- No gappy, choppy, or super extended candles. Gappy usually means a lot of action is happening outside market hours or in international markets. Look at DB for example. Choppy means just way too much fluctuation to mentally handle. Extended is *typically* no more than 10% from the 8EMA, but smaller priced or more volatile stocks can move more. Use your judgement. Longs seem to be less dangerous extended than shorts. Remember the goal isn't good trades, it's the cream of the cream of the crop.

**"Stacked" Sector Strength/Weakness** \- The stock has rs/rw to it's sector AND the sector has rs/rw to the market on the d1 5 day rolling relative strength. This provides some extra push and ensures that it's not just moving from some speculative news like TWTR or TLRY. Are those good trades? Sure! But they aren't the *safest possible* trades. You want to basically be at the crest of the wave of whatever institutions are doing. Are they selling Tech? You're selling the 'most selling' part of that.

**High Relative Volume** \- You need to make sure the stock is being *PUSHED*, not just coasting. For example a stock can go up because there's below average selling, OR if there's above average buying. The latter is better because if things go back to baseline buying/selling, the stock should just cruise instead of reverse.

Relative volume needs to be +20% OR above 0% and *clearly* rising in response to technical levels being breached. You need to make sure you're measuring volume in relation to the average volume of that stock *at that time of day.* On TC2000 this is "volume buzz" above +20%. Other platforms are different, just make sure you're measuring the right thing.

&#x200B;

**Daily Void** \- The stock needs room to actually move and create a decent reward. At least 1% void available before and support/resistance/algo/trendline. *This is frequently missed so double, even triple check this.*

&#x200B;

**Intraday Timing** \- If you can really nail the intraday void, your chances of the trade going against you initially greatly diminishes and it'll immediately profit. Make sure you have good confirmation of line breaks, AND you aren't bumping up against a 5' trendline. zoom out the chart to check. I just click my entry point and drag a line back and see if there's too may wicks touching that line.

If you miss this one it's less of a big deal with a killer D1, you just might have to hold on the trade until the next bearish/bullish cycle. Just understand that sometimes those cycles take long enough for a sector rotation or market shift to occur. That bounce off the 5' trendline might be the 5th and final one before a macro move back up.

**NEED AT LEAST ONE OF THESE**This turns a solid trade into an exceptional one that has more durability. It's basically a strong tell that the stock is being moved by institutions.

**All Time High/Low** \- doesn't always have to literally be ath/atl. The reason why this is strong is because there's no potential sellers or buyers beyond this point to hammer the stock back beyond profit taking. No bag holders.

**D1 Event** \- In order of strength is Horizontal Support/Resistance breaks, then SMA breaks, then Algo line breaks is the strongest(probably of every trait period). Be very very sure of your algo lines. I find them challenging to get right. Price points will probably be the strongest but I don't understand them so I don't trade them.

**Compression Break** \- if the d1 chart is in a tight range for a while then pops out of it, the move can be pretty explosive.  Get confirmation. because these might not show RS/RW the same way as other stocks. These definitely need serious volume.

**Heiken Ashi Continution** \- I like these because they're simple and indicate a solid trend. If you are on the 3rd candle of the same colour that has a flat side, that's an HA continuation.

**HOW TO FIND THESE**

This is a lot of criteria, so it's a lot of data to juggle. Here's the steps I've found to get a real time sweep of all the stocks that are doing this through the day.

**Step 1** \- Scan by event/trait. Have a scan/search that finds stocks that are doing the "at least one of these" traits. Also by  high/low of the day. Stocks are their highest or lowest of the day are usually doing something good and tradable. If there's none, I move to the next step.

**Step 2** \- Sort by relative volume and/or stacked sectors. doing this first narrows the search down do you only have to mark up a few charts instead of hundreds.

**Step 3** \- Check D1's. Ones that *could* be good of they break a level go on alert. Ones that *are* good go on a watchlist

**Step 4** \- Constantly do this all day and keep your list updated/trimmed

**Step 5** \- Wait for the right market conditions and the best entries on your list. I usually take my top 2-5 on my watchlist and have them on deck in my platform ready to activate.
