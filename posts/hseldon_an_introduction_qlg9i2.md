So many of you have shared your stories with me, many of them deeply personal.  It is only right that I share some things about myself.

First the basics - I am 48 years old, live in Los Angeles, and I'm married (second marriage) with two kids: A 16 year old and 2 year old son.  My 23andMe shows a mix across Europe, but overall I am Jewish (Mother Jewish, thus, I am Jewish), Italian, Irish, German, and Albanian/Russian.  Been an atheist since I was 9 years old.

I grew up poor, like living in a car, sharing a Snickers bar with my two siblings as our "treat" for the week, type of poor.  Usual sad story - Father left when I was 3, mentally ill Mother estranged from her relatives, etc..etc.  Mental illness runs in my family, and I was not left untouched by  this genetic "gift".

Some interesting things about myself (and I assure you it is all true):

My Grandfather (Maternal) was a world class Pianist and conductor, trained at Juilliard.  His Grandmother (my Great, Great Grandmother) was Leah Einstein.  And his Great Great Grandfather was Abraham Einstein, whose only claim to fame, as far as I know, is in being Albert's Father.    Of course since Albert went ahead and married his own Cousin, my Aunt Elsa ,the family tree doesn't exactly fork in some spots.

I showed an aptitude for Physics at a young age, and eventually went on to get a scholarship to Cornell in the subject.  Upon arriving there, because of my family relations, it became clear that the expectations they had were....unreachable.  This led to probably the only time in my life I walked away from a challenge, as there is just no way I was going to beat E=MC squared.

It is also noteworthy that at the age of 10 I became obsessed with the Foundation series from Isaac Asimov (my youngest son's middle name is Isaac), and the notion of creating a way to predict human behavior. *Hence my screen name HSeldon - which stands for Hari Seldon, the main protagonist of the Foundation series.* This series is now a TV show on Apple - I like show (waited like 38 years for it), but it is, unfortunately, very different from the books.  Anyway, leaving physics and going into Sociology was an easy transition given my hope to one day "model humanity" and predict it.   This obsession would wind up dictating the course of my life.

As I worked through undergraduate and then graduate school (SUNY Stony Brook - stayed close to home to care for a sick mother), I got engaged 7 times - and lost all 7 rings (yeah, they kept them).  One engagement was called off a month before the wedding and, I wound up marrying the bridesmaid (my first wife, and mother to the 16 year old son).

Thankfully I am now married to an amazing woman (who is also an excellent trader herself) and have given out my last ring. And for those of you that are going to trade for a living, and I can't stress this enough - *make sure you have a partner that understands what you do and what it entails.*

After school I went on to be a Professor of Sociology and Statistics, where I created predictive models for opening weekend box-office for movies, which led me to the film industry. (*turns out that the two things that have enough data to be predictive are* ***elections*** *and* ***box-office***\*, and movies were more fun).\*  Once there I ran several research and marketing consulting companies, invented new ways to analyze content, started two companies,  and eventually headed up Strategy for a major studio.  I topped off my career in the entertainment industry by co-founding a studio, and releasing theatrical movies.

I've spent my fair share of time and money in both Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  Gambling has always been a part of life - one that I had to get under control at times.  Through the years I also became an excellent poker player.  At one point I considered playing for a living, going as far has having Annie Duke work with me to improve my game.  In the end though, it wasn't a matter of skill, it was a matter of not wanting to actually sit at a table with *people* for hours and hours every day.

Several years ago I turned to trading, and that story is documented in another post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/nzxydj/how\_i\_got\_started/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/nzxydj/how_i_got_started/).

One other thing you should know -

Despite having several high profile jobs that were public facing (I've been on the cover of the New York Times, various news programs and outlets, etc.) I have an absolute disdain for people in general.    I wouldn't say I am an introvert, more like a misanthrope.  My preference is to stay in the house and only interact face-to-face with a few select individuals - something the pandemic made quite easy for me.   *However*, while I tend to not like *people*, I also can not stand watching someone get screwed over when they are just trying to get ahead in life - which describes many of you.   Whether it is a government that does not have your interest at heart, or people trying to scam you into buying their "get rich quick" system, it seems that no matter where you turn, there is someone there trying to push you back down.

*And that is why I created this sub* \- to make a place that is dedicated to actually lifting people back up.  Watching so many of you actually *get it* as you become successful traders, it truly a great source of happiness for me.

I left out many details concerning my father - an Italian-American that oversaw construction sites in Staten Island, as you can watch an episode of the Sopranos which would pretty much sum him up.   There are other parts my of life that would even further stretch the bounds of believability, so I'll also leave those out for the sake of brevity.

So there you have it -since so many of you have said I have become a significant part of your life, I figured you should know a little bit about who I am.

*And* so you know I am a real person - this me:
