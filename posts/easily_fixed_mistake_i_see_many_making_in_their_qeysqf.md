Recently I asked many of you to post trades that didn't work out for you this past week, and I said I would take a look.

One thing definitely pops out at me - most of you are picking excellent stocks.  Really strong daily charts, excellent strength against the market, and good volume.  *However,* you are **all** buying at the tail-end of stacking green candles on the M5, and not waiting for a pullback to the 8EMA before buying.

These are FOMO trades you are making - you see green candles stacking, and start getting worried - the price keeps going up and you keep missing it.  At some point you become convinced that this stock is not going to pullback and you go long.   

It what seems like an instant reaction, the moment you go long, the stock reverses and finally pulls back.  

There are four ways to play this.  For this example, let's say Stock XYZ opens at $100, and after the first hour it is at $101.50 and climbing.  Daily chart is very strong, and the stock has relative strength to the market.  You can either: 

1) Buy half a position at $101.50.  If it continues to go up without a pullback (rare but it happens), then you can add the second half of your position at $102, average at $101.75.  

2) Buy half a position at $101.50. Stock pulls back to the 8EMA, consolidates there, and begins to go back up - in which case you add when it starts going up, giving you an average cost of $101.30.

3) You wait for the pullback - it consolidates, and begins to go up, you go long with a full position at $101.30.

4) You wait for the pullback - it either consolidates and drops, or continues to drop, eventually going under the 8EMA, and you don't buy, saving yourself from having a losing position. 

 Notice what is not in these choices?  A full position at the entry that is extended from the 8EMA.
