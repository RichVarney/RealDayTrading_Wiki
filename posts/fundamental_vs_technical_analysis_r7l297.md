EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

There seems to be a lot of confusion around this issue, so hopefully this will clarify things a bit.

**Fundamental Analysis:** This is used by *Long Term* traders. This deals with the overall health of a company - amount of cash on hand, long-term guidance, price to earnings ratios, etc. If you are trying to figure out where a company will be a year or two from now, this type of analysis needs to be part of your decision-making process.

If you are holding a stock for a week, a day, a few hours, a few minutes, you do **not** need *Fundamental Analysis.* Why? Because if I buy a stock at 9:50am and sell it 30 minutes later, I don't even need to know what the company is that I am trading, let alone what their profit margins are.

**Technical Analysis:** There is a lot of disagreement on this board about TA - most likely because it is a *very* broad area of study. TA (Technical Analysis) covers everything that has to do with price, volume and time. All the indicators, charts, candlesticks, Heiken Ashi, trendlines, moving averages, standard deviations, support/resistance, etc....all of it is TA. So is price action, option pricing through B-S modeling, Level 2, volume studies, crossovers, time trends, etc. All *short-term* trading is based off of *Technical Analysis*, whether it is Day Trading (round-trip trades within the same day) or Swing Trading (holding a position for a few days/weeks).

Yes there are external catalysts that one might trade, but what you are really trading is the impact of that catalyst on price and volume, which is - *Technical Analysis.*

These two forms of analysis are the two pillars of trading, everything falls underneath these categories. Both work, and both takes years of study to get right.

I've heard people say, "If Technical Analysis works, why do so many fail at Day Trading?" Simple - because it takes an immense amount of time and effort that most people do not want to put in, to master TA. And even among those who do put in the time and effort, some can not resist the urge to simply gamble. That alone knocks out a huge percentage of people who try.

Since this is a Day Trading board, Technical Analysis is the foundation on which you need to build your career. Rejecting TA as a Day Trader is like wanting to be a doctor and rejecting modern medicine.

Is all of TA correct? No. Personally I think more than half the indicators are bullshit. But through learning the entire field, you will be able to discern what works for you and what doesn't.

Either way, I hope this helps people understand the difference between the two and what each mean.
