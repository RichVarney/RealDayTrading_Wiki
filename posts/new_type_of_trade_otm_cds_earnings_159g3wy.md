Ok, bear with me as I am working out a new kind of trade here - one that is based more in pure statistical odds than Technical Analysis.

Let's start with some basics:

Before any stock has quarterly earnings, market makers have an expected range of movement baked into the option prices.  A rough estimate on what that range might be can be derived by simply adding the ATM Call and Put prices - or better known as the cost of a straddle.

For example - **MSFT** reports tonight.  The ATM Calls are $9.40 and ATM Puts are $9.10 - that gives a total expected range of +/- $18.50.

Next we look at the likelihood of hitting the upper end of that range.

Roughly 70% of all stock go up after earnings (doesn't seem like it, but it is right around there), but not all of them hit the upper range of their estimate move.

For example, $MSFT may go up tonight, but it may only go up $7 overall, which is within the projected range, but towards lower middle between $0 and $18.50.

Again, rough estimate here would be that by the Friday expiration of those ATM Options, roughly 50% of the stocks that report earnings will be close to the upper-end of the range (which makes sense as that is the reason for those option prices).

Stick with me here - this will *all* make sense in the end.

Now think of an OTM Call Debit Spread - you buy the lower call and sell the upper call for a debit.  So for **MSFT** buying the $357.5 Call and selling the $367.5 Call that expires this Friday would cost you roughly $2.70.

What that means is if **MSFT** is at or over $367.5 come the expiration on Friday, the spread would be worth $10.  Why?  Because imagine it came in at $367.5 exactly - then the $357.5 Call would be worth $10 and the $367.5 Call would be worth $0 = $10.  Every dollar you go up from there you just add a $1 to the $357.5 Calls you are Long on and subtract $1 from the $367.5 Calls you have sold = i.e., it stays worth $10.

Since you spent $2.70 on it, your profit (if this occurs) would be $7.30.   That is a 2.7X ROI.

If after earnings **MSFT** has only a 27% chance of going over $167.5, you would break even because let's say you did this trade 100 times.

27 times you made $7.30 profit which is $197.10 \* 100 = $19,710

73 times you lost $2.70 which is $197.10 \*100 = $19,710

(it is actually more favorable than this as many times even though it doesn't hit the upper end of the range you won't lose the entire $2.70 on the spread, but for the purposes of this example I am assuming the worst)

Thus, in this case you would just need better than a 27% chance that **MSFT** goes above $167.5 by Friday - and given that 70% of stocks go up after earnings, and the range here is $18.50 (which put it above $367.50), it would seem that just based on pure odds alone this become a profitable play to make.

You could even do the $355/$365 for $3.30 and you would just need a 33% chance for **MSFT** to go above $365 (a lower bar) to break even.

**MSFT** is only an example here, but this would work with any stock that has a high enough range to allow for an OTM CDS that is in the range of $3.50 or lower.

I am sure one could back-test this method somehow, but I am going to be trying it live in the meantime.

**Edit: A key statistic here will be the historical likelihood of a stock hitting the upper-end of its projected range on earnings by the Friday expiration.**

Best, H.S.
