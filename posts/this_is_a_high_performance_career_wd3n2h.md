I’ve been thinking about this topic for weeks now, and as I continue to move forward in my trading career and experience my and other traders’ successes and roadblocks, I am continuously asking myself what I need to do to ‘level up’, to be more consistent and more profitable. What new skills do I need to master to double my profit factor? Study more? Learn more technicals? New trading techniques? Dive further into options? Fundamentals? Better entries? Exits? Sizing? Trade management?

Well, as I look back and analyze my major mistakes, the answer is ‘yea kinda’ to everything. Polishing my trade management and avoiding sloppy trading will get me better results, as will better entries, better risk management, etc.  But there is a clear outlier that we tend not to talk about because engaging it can be quite uncomfortable: the mental game. Stamina, confidence, emotion management… self image. The really hard stuff. The Long Game.  We work very very hard to understand the technicals of trading, but how much time are you investing in **becoming** a trader? 

There will come a time in your career when your understanding of your edge and technicals is good enough that your mistakes will be mostly a result of mental ‘slips’: overtrading, revenge trading, going ‘on tilt’, FOMOing into a trade, letting losers run, etc. (Everything Hari outlines in his [Top mindset issues and their solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/v23nis/top_5_mindset_issues_and_the_solutions/) and other mindset posts found in the [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/wiki/index/))—where your self image will be unconsciously holding you back or letting you run only to pull the rug from under you and bring you back to your mean. 

And this is where other very good traders and I currently stand, some giving back a week/month’s/year’s profit on a bad day or a series of bad days.  Traders that are very very intelligent and have worked very very hard for a long time, and who know their technicals and executions very, very well. So what gives? 

I’d like to encourage you (and myself) to consider day trading as a high-performance sport, and think about what you would do to train and perform as a professional athlete at the highest level.  A professional athlete in an individual sport, no less (tennis, gymnastics, golf, swimming, skiing . . .), where the outcome is entirely dependent on you.  Where you can’t just ‘show up’ and have your teammates pick up the slack during a game where you just feel ‘ok’. Where not being engaged and 100% ready physically and mentally against a very well prepared opponent will most probably mean you will lose spectacularly in front of millions of people and children that want to grow up to be like you will lose all hope for their little futures.

Would you enter the arena having not slept well? Having not eaten properly? Emotionally drained or exhausted? Injured? Unprepared? Thinking you don’t deserve to be there?  Afraid of losing? You’d get chewed up. 

 I argue that for those of us that have been at this for a year or more and are beginning to be consistently profitable week after week and maybe month after month, our biggest level up will be a result of engaging our psyche, our ego, our temperament and our resolve in order to figure out which one(s) of those is/are holding us back and preventing us from breaking out. 

Here is a quick personal anecdote that may drive my point home:

 *A big breakthrough for me was when I realized I am, inherently, a gambler. It took me 5 or 6 reads of Hari’s Posts on mindset issues and a few very emotional beat downs by the market for me to invest the mental energy necessary to expose it and come to grips with it. And figuring this out was a huge turning point for me.*  *Let me explain a little more:*

  *I really, really, very much dislike Vegas. To be more specific, I abhor the whole atmosphere around gambling and people losing control and losing everything they have in games where the odds are very heavily stacked against them.* 

 

*Yet in my life and career I’ve been a jump-off-and-build-the-parachute-on-the-way-down kinda guy.*  *First one in last one out.*  *I’ve opened up a few businesses (always risky) and I’ve never held a steady job with a steady paycheck working for a large company. I’m ‘I’ll figure it out when I get there but let’s go’.*  *I enjoy skiing off stuff, parachuting, paragliding, surfing, going fast, etc.*  *In other words, I am not really averse to risk.*  *In other words, I enjoy the adrenaline. In other words . . . . I like to gamble? This was eye-opening. And it was so buried inside of me by my dislike of ‘Vegas’ that it was very very difficult to admit.*  *I hate Vegas because I’m a gambler and I dislike that part of myself. Boom.*  *Mind=blown.*  *Floodgates opened.* 

*This single ‘aha’ moment completely changed my trading.*  *Not more technicals, better executions, fancy options, better entries . . .*  *This.*  *Because I now know when I’m gambling and tag it as such, no longer ashamed of it but no longer controlled by it.*  

 

So as you more experienced traders are prepping for the coming week, looking at charts, analyzing futures, making a game plan, I encourage you to take a more holistic approach to your trading and consider prioritizing your time as if it were a high-level sport.  Add sleep, exercise, diet, and rest to it. Add family time, game time, and distance from the markets (as u/lilsgymdan will most surely confirm, rest and diet are just as important to a training regiment than the exercises themselves.  Resting after a solid base is what ‘peaks’ athletes before a big event). Disconnect and add time to THINK so that when you’re in the arena you can act.

And for those of you just starting your journey, remember that your biggest obstacle will be yourself, and I’d encourage you to include a lot (a lot) of trading psychology and mental work into your training.
