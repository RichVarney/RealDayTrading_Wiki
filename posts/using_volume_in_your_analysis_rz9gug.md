By now members here are used to hearing me say, "Read the Wiki" to most questions.  I say that because the Wiki contains the answers to just about any inquiry.  However, it was pointed out to me that there was a glaring omission - **Volume**.

This post hopefully corrects that omission.  

To begin with, when you think of **Volume** you should think of it as *money going in and out of the underlying ticker.*  

Knowing the **Volume** of a stock by itself does not give you any usable information - because *selling* and *buying* **Volume** is all counted the same in the total number.  

So we rely on the charts themselves - we can see the volume of any given bar, and if the price of the ticker ended the bar lower than it started, the bar on volume shows up as *red* and in the reverse, it is *green*.

Simple enough.  But again, there is no order of magnitude there.  A $100 stock could have dropped $2 in one 5-min bar and the volume would be red, or it could have dropped 1 cent and it would still be red.

Therefore it gives you *direction* but not the magnitude of that direction.  Which is why we look at the price movement *and* the volume to discern the difference.  In other words, we can see how much the ticker dropped or gained and thus, know the magnitude. 

In general, for traders, *high* volume is good and *low* volume is bad.  *High* volume provide liquidity (tighter bid/ask spreads because there are constantly buyers and sellers engaged) and organized directional movement (usually).  *Low* volume generally results in choppy and unpredictable price movements with wide bid/ask spreads, which creates a low probability trading environment. 

But what does *high* volume mean? A volume of 10 million is great for a stock like **DBX** but would be very anemic for **MSFT** \- so *high* and *low* is *Relative*.  Hence the importance of *Relative Volume* \- essentially, how much higher or lower than average is the volume on any particular bar.  If a ticker has a Relative Volume of 1.7 that means there is 1.7X's the average or 170%.    If you don't have *Relative Volume* on your charts, you should - it is a basic equation Current Volume/Average Volume.  Standard is to use the moving average of 50 periods on the daily chart.  And personally, I use 78 periods on the 5 min chart. 

Finally, the last piece of the puzzle is an overall trend of whether the volume is more weighted to sellers or to buyers.  For this you can use **On Balance Volume** \- a very simple indicator that either adds or substracts the volume from the total based on whether the stock went up or not. 

So let's put it all together and see how it tells a story on **SPY:**

Here you can see a clear divergence before the price history on **SPY** and the **OBV** \- the overall price kept climbing towards the end of the year, but the **OBV** indicates that the volume is getting increasingly bearish - how is that possible?

Well, look at the Relative Volume - on the days **SPY** went up, volume was *lower* than average, and on the days it went down volume was *higher* on average.  And what happened? **SPY** dropped.  

Let's check it on stock this time and revisit the story of **MSFT**:

&#x200B;

Once again, we see **OBV** in a clear downward trend, but **MSFT** remains flat with no change. Another divergence.  But look at the **RV**, see that dip on the right hand side with the green line dropping into a trough?  That dip in *Relative Volume* below 1 is when **MSFT** was stacking green bars**,** but every time there is a red bar on **MSFT** look at **RV** grow.

We see a similar pattern here - the volume is much stronger on the days the stock declines than when it goes up.  And what happens?  **MSFT** drops. 

Now there are many other indicators for volume - *Volume Profile* is very popular; however, what that indicator really does (other than clutter the shit out of your chart) is give you a good indication of where lines of *Support/Resistance* lie.  Useful, yes - but you can ascertain that without *Volume Profile*.  And yes, there are pivot points, and buy/sell zones, which in my view are all redundant to information you already get using SMA's, EMA's, trend/algo lines and horizontal Support/Resistance.   

One exception is **VWAP**, which is useful on the 5-min chart, i.e. if a $100 goes to $104 on heavy volume and then drops on lower volume, the average price of the stock is going to be weighted more towards the price changes that had volume behind it.  

My advice? Do not over-complicate your analysis - if you have **volume**, then you see the *direction*, the *magnitude* of that direction, and the *relative* nature of the volume itself - and with that information you can add to the story the chart is telling you.  Are the price increases happening on lower than average volume and the decreases on higher - is the OBV dropping even the stock is going up?  Well it may not be time to short (you need confirmation first), but one should definitely consider exiting any longs.

As always, I hope this helps - 

Best, H.S.
