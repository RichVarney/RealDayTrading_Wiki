One of the first things you learn when you start trading is - **Don't Average Down!** 

You have probably heard this so often that it probably seems like gospel.  It also *feels* like a good rule, doesn't it?  I mean, why throw good money after bad?  Do you really want to add to an already losing position? 

Hell no you don't!  That would just be plum stupid! 

Still, let's be honest - we all know that we do it, but we don't admit it.  It is a bit like Coldplay - sure I like the songs, but if anyone asked me if I am a fan I would say, "Fuck no! I hate Coldplay!"  (Then again I was probably the only kid in my High School that listened to Barry Manilow....I mean, Mandy....come on, it doesn't get better than that!)  

Anyway, the point is that *Averaging Down* is like a dirty little secret.

The funny thing is that when Investors do it, they call it "**Dollar Cost Averaging"** \- a big ole fancy term that generally just means they are averaging down (Investors rarely seem to use the DCA strategy when their positions are up, which is moronic because that is *exactly* when you should do it).  Sure they will say they are simply adding X number of shares no matter the cost at the same time each month/week/whatever.  But most of the time - they are just *averaging down*.    

However, in the world of trading, we have collectively rushed to demonize the strategy.  In fact, traders were so adamant that *averaging down* was a bad bad thing, that we seem to have forgotten that there are times when *it can also be a very effective technique*.

I will caveat this by saying I was/am very hesitant to write this post.  Why?  To be blunt - because most of you will fuck it up.  There is probably an entire Wiki's worth of material I could write on "Advanced Trading Techniques", but I know that moment I post something on that topic, everyone will attempt strategies they aren't remotely ready to implement.  Traders that do not do this for a living and/or are not consistently profitable, *always* think they are farther ahead than reality (or their account balance) would dictate.  

***Still, this one seemed fun and I wanted to write it - just, please - practice this, use it sparingly, and do not fall down the money-draining rabbit hole with it.*** 

So - when does it make sense to *average down*?  We will focus on one scenario - **Right idea, wrong time**.

Here's an example: Let's say on some random Monday you have a well formed thesis on the market and based on all your analysis you feel that **SPY** is going to drop, perhaps even test the SMA 100 on the daily.  There you are, wearing your "Bearish AF" T-Shirt and ready trade.  **SPY** gaps down and after patiently waiting for the first thirty minutes to pass, you are ready to Buy some Puts.  You grab the ITM $395 SPY Puts that expire that Friday and you got 5 of them for $6.75 each.  That's $3,375 you just spent on your thesis.  **SPY** is at $392.10 when you got the options.

Then, **SPY** being the little mindfuck of an ETF that it is, winds up chopping around in a narrow range for the next four days.  All the while, your Puts are bleeding Theta. By the time Friday comes along those $395 Puts are now worth $1 each with **SPY** sitting at $394.50.  Over the past four days **SPY** chopped around between $390 and $395.  Currently sitting at the upper-end of that range, you are down $2,875, you're hurt, wounded, and wondering how to move on from this betrayal.    

At this point, in order for you to even think about breaking even you need **SPY** to hit $388.50 - and it is Friday morning, day of expiration.  

Should you have closed the trade earlier in the week? Yeah, probably - but we all know what happens - it is a slow death, not immediate.  Each day takes away just a little bit more, but also teases that it can come back and make everything right with the world again.  So you sit there, like Charlie Bucket without a golden ticket.  Grandpa Joe, that knucklefuck, is dancing around without a care in the world - like he always could - but did he help out? Did he get a job? NO! The lazy shit just lied there in that rank bed pretending like he can't do a damn thing except chew that tobacco while the family ate water soup for dinner.   

Anyway - here's the thing, it finally looks like **SPY** is going to drop like you thought it would (**you had the right idea, just the wrong time for it) -** it just go rejected off resistance again, some FED speaker came out and said, "Hell yeah we are raising rates - and we're gonna keep raising them! You hear me? We're gonna KEEP RAISING THEM and there is not a damn thing you can do about it!! Powell ain't here to save you now, he got the 'Vid so its me now motherfuckers!"   Needless to say you are pretty certain **SPY** is gonna come down hard.  

If you bought 10 more of those Put Contracts at $1 each, you would have 15 $395 **SPY** Puts at an average cost of $2.91 and a total cost of $4,375.  That means you would be spending 29.6% more money ($1,000 more than your original $3,375), but in doing so, you reduced your average cost by 56.8% ($6.75 to $2.91).  On top of that, you now need **SPY** to just get to $392.50 by mid-day for those Options to be worth $2.91, which is entirely doable.

That long story is meant to illustrate a few things - 

\- **Context** : you may have had the right thesis on a stock or the market, but your timing was off.  However, your standard for maintaining that thesis needs to get higher for each day it does not come to fruition.  If in the above example **SPY** became bullish and went over $395 (or through some technical line of Resistance) the thesis becomes invalidated.  At that point you take the loss.  But, if the underlying does not violate any technical level and you have good reason to hold, then you need to consider....

\- **Math:**  in the case above you increased your investment by roughly 30% and got a 57% improvement on your average cost.  That is an exchange that works well in your favor. Although that is only the case when....

\- **Probability**: just because something is possible does not mean it is probable. Is it possible that **AAPL** could go to $300 a share tomorrow? Yes, it is possible.  Is it probable? Fuck no. In the example above, before averaging down you needed **SPY** to hit $389 to have a chance at breaking even on the trade.   That would have been a drop of $5.50 - certainly possible, but not very probable.  After averaging down you need **SPY** to get to $392.50, a drop of $2 - which is not only possible, but also probable given the setup.  

If you did not average down, and sold your Options when they hit $2.91, you would have lost $3.83 per contract, or $1,917 - which is 50% of your money.  However, because you invested an additional $1,000, now when **SPY** hits $392.50 and those contracts are worth $2.91, you are able to break-even.  In fact, you even have a chance at making a profit.

Again - this is not something that should be a habit, nor is it an acceptable solution every time you are down in a position - in fact, it is *rarely* an acceptable solution.  However, there are times when it *does* make sense and if you find yourself in one of those times you **can** *average down* without shame.  In fact, you can now proudly state to the world, *"I fucked up, I'm losing money - but I am so confident in my screw-up that I am going to put in more money and double down! "* 

Actually, when you say it like that it sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?  

So yeah, don't *average down* mmmmkay?  Or do....

Best, H.S.
