**Relative Strength**

Think of 100 people running a race, and they are all running into 100mph winds.  About 75 of them get knocked back or simply can't move forward.  Another 20 or so are able to get ahead, but slower than they normally would have - and the final 5 are running as if there is no wind at all.

Now, if the wind reversed and those runners all had the wind at their backs, who do you think would win the race?  If you are thinking the 5 runners that were able to get ahead despite having the wind against them, you would probably be right.

In this analogy, the *wind* is **SPY** and the runners are the stocks.  Like a rising tide **SPY** tends to lift or drop most stocks, roughly 3/4th of all stock will follow that ETF even if they are not part of the index themselves. By identifying the stocks that have strength (or weakness) independent of **SPY**, you have an amazing trading edge - as you know that the stocks that are going up even as **SPY** drops or stays the flat, are going to surge when the market bounces (much like the runner with wind at their back).

Calculating **Relative Strength** is not as easy as one might assume - 

Obviously the foundation of the calculation needs to be the difference between a stock and **SPY** percent change.  This calculation can be done on a daily basis, 5-min basis, etc.  Let's say you wanted to look at it over a 5-min basis (which is most useful for Day Trading), and since you would want recent results (as a stock's *Relative Strength* changes throughout the day) you go back the last 12 candles (or 1 hr).

Stock A goes up 1% and **SPY** goes up .5% during that hour - meaning stock A over-indexed **SPY** 2 to 1 in its' increase.  **Relative Strength**, right?  Maybe not.

What if Stock A typically goes up or down 2% an hour (the *ATR* of Stock A each hour), while **SPY** typically goes up or down .5%, which is exactly what it did.  That means in this example Stock A is going up 1/2 the typical amount expected, while SPY is right on target.  So that balances it out, meaning - No **Relative Strength**, right?  Maybe not.

You also need to take volume into account as well.  Like I said, not that easy.

I use the indicators to help me identify the stocks with **Relative Strength**.  Just be careful though when looking for the right indicator, as some, like the one on ThinkorSwim, use a basic correlation matrix to calculate **Relative Strength**, which is a mistake - for example, if a stock is moving up while **SPY** is flat, there would be little to no correlation, but yet that stock would most likely have **Relative Strength**.  However, ThinkorSwim, allows you to code just about anything, so it should be possible to create the measure that works.

**BETA** is another indicator, but that measures the relative difference in volatility between a stock and an index, which while a useful measure at times, is not the same thing.

And of course **RSI** which is something completely differently altogether (and not very useful in my not-so-humble opinion). 

It is important to *always* keep the 5-min chart of **SPY** running on a popped out chart so you can look at it when looking at your stocks.  And it is also always useful to simply map **SPY** on to the charts so you can see how each move at the same time.

Either way, based on the posts and the questions I've seen, I thought I would help clear up the concept a bit.

Best, H.S.
