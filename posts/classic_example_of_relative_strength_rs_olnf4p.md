This is an example of relative strength (RS). DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE RSI INDICATOR. They are two vastly different concepts. One is a worthless indicator and the other is the best trading edge you can ever have. 

I tried to post this image when I answered a question, but apparently only the original post can have images. 

Please study this chart. We search for relative strength (RS) on multiple time frames.
