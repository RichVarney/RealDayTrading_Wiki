Hello RDT!

For any of you who are use ThinkorSwim, you know there can be issues with lag, overall sluggish movement, flickering of charts, and many more small but annoying 'ticks' the system has when running a good amount of charts/studies. Having just bought a brand new PC that was more than capable of running it, I struggled with these ticks as well (with absolutely no help from TDA support at the time). Having tried everything, here are the main adjustments that have worked so far, which may or may not also work for you. Please be careful when tinkering with these settings, and make note of the defaults in case you need to reset. For reference, here is what my setup is right now: https://ibb.co/SxSf79D running on Windows 11. I have eight 5M stock windows on one screen, 6 D1 and 2 Chart layouts on the bottom screen, screeners/watchlists/trading windows on the left, and of course OptionStalker on the right. No issues at all with lag, and no issues at all with sluggishness. 


*1) Using multiple ToS instances:*

This might be the end all be all for the majority of you. This option will indefinitely require you to create multiple workstations for each instance, but your ToS experience will be free of lag. Simply open up ToS twice, log in twice, and configure your windows appropriately.

*2) Memory Usage (Under "settings" cog at the bottom of the login screen):*

If your computer meets all (or exceeds) the basic requirements to run ToS, and you only want to run one instance, open up the cog at the small login window and change the memory usage according to these calculations. Minimum = 512Mb and Maximum = 2046Mb for 8GB RAM, 4098 for 16GB of RAM, and 8192 for 32GB of RAM. 

*3) Collect Garbage (ToS Customer Service's Answer):*

During the day, the system might start to slow down randomly. If you navigate to the "Help" tab -> "System" -> "Collect Garbage", you will manually free up some of the used memory which should hopefully provide a nice speed boost. Be careful if you decide to use this when actively trading, as I have had ToS freeze shortly after collecting the garbage, requiring an annoying and time-wasting application reboot.

Hope this was useful. Happy New Year RDT!
