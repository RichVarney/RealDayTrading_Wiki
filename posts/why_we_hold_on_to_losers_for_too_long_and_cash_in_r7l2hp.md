Anyone can learn Day Trading - if you put in the time and effort to do it, learning how to successfully Day Trade isn't difficult. Obviously, the time and effort part is hard for some people, but overall, if you really dedicate your energy to learning this, you can do it.

If that was all there was to this, there would be many more successful Day Traders than there are right now. But that is not all there is to it.

Mindset is the other half of Day Trading. And in many ways, it is much harder than learning all the technical analysis skills you need. Because the mindset you need to be successful at Day Trading is, in large part, opposite to the one most of us have in life.

In life, most of us are used to bad shit happening. It happens all the time. When it does, we generally are hoping that maybe, just maybe this time it will turn around. Something has to go right eventually.

And then what happens when something finally does go our way? We wait for the other shoe to drop. Because it can't possibly last.

Some people might lead a charmed life, but most of us haven't. For most people, Life is Unfair and the best you can hope for is that if you try hard enough, maybe you'll catch a break.

Now combine this mindset, with another, which can be summed up by that immortal line from *The Color of Money* \- "Money won is twice as sweet as money earned." Very true. When you get a paycheck you don't jump up and down screaming in excitement, but win $50 on a slot machine and people go crazy. We like winning money. It feels a little bit like we are re-balancing those scales that weigh heavily down on the "Life is Unfair" side of the ledger. I enjoy making $1,000 off a quick momentum trade much more than making $1,500 from an OTM BPS that I have had on for 3 weeks. It makes no logical sense and it never will, but I suspect I am not the only one who feels this way.

Putting these two mindsets together can be extremely costly in Day Trading, and they go to the heart of why we let our losers run and cut our winners short.

When our trade is working, we want the win. Why? Because we are still afraid of that other shoe dropping. Nobody wants to be up in a trade and wind up closing it out later as a loser - that is even more painful than if the trade was never up in the first place. So we try to avoid that by taking profits, fast. Now there are many reasons to take profits - the market turned against you, the stock hit resistance (or support if your shorting), volume dried up, or perhaps you simply reached your target. But many of us don't take profit for that reason, *we take profit because we are in profit, period*. Everyone on here can talk about Risk|Reward ratios all they want, but in reality you shouldn't even been looking at your P&L at all.

The other side of the coin is even worse - when we are down, we suddenly have incredible faith that the stock will turn around. ***In a cruel twist of ironic fate, we are hard-wired to have more confidence in the loser turning around, than in the winner to keep on winning.*** So now we are stuck in a vicious cycle - believing our losers will turn around, and our winners will stop winning. We also believe that we haven't lost until we closed the trade. Are you down $4,000? No! Because I am still in the trade, I am only down that money if I sell it!

Where does that leave you? With small wins and huge losses.

The most obvious solution is position size. Most people trade with positions so large that it not only eats up all their buying power, but causes a mental breakdown when the stock drops. You need to figure out the right position size to where it makes a difference in terms of your overall portfolio, but isn't so large that it can crush you in one candle.

Adjusting your position size is the first step, but the second is to trade as if you only have one share, because the only way to rid yourself of this mindset, is to remove emotion from the equation. Which means removing money from the equation.

All that matters are the technicals - and if you don't believe that, than you believe you are gambling, in which case just like in a casino the house will win. And you aren't the house.

I bought **CARV** all the way up at $14, and I still have it. Why? Because until **CARV** breaks support at the 50/100 SMA (right around $10) I have no reason to close the trade. However, I also had **UPST** at 126.50, and the moment it broke the SMA 50 at 124.78 I closed it. Now if this was a matter of the P&L, it would be reversed, I would still have **UPST** and would have dropped **CARV**. But I know, that if on every trade I follow where the charts lead me, at the end of the month my P&L is going to be right where I need it to be, with a predictable win rate, predictable profit per win/debit per loss, and average number of trades.

The mindset described above is very hard to get rid of - and trying to change it requires more than just the desire to do so, more than realizing it is a problem, it requires removing as much emotion-driven choices as possible.

When looking at a losing trade, ask yourself these questions:

**1)** *If you werenâ€™t in this trade currently, would you enter it now?*

**2)** *Do the reasons you entered the trade still apply (e.g. is it still strong relative to the market, is it still above support, does it still have volume?)*

**3)** *Is your money better spent in a different trade?*

You'll find that a lot of the time the answers to those questions are **No, No, Yes**.

At the end of the month, all that matters is that you hit your goal. There is nothing special about ***that*** trade where you ***have*** to make your money back from ***that*** stock. You don't. Find a better trade.

***However -***

If the trade is working in your favor, you should have *more* confidence in it than if it was against you. If you are that worried about the other shoe dropping, you can always take off part of your position and let the rest ride.

This isn't a post about the technical indicators, because if that is all it took, than there wouldn't be an issue. First and foremost is to not let the desire to "have a winner" dictate your decision making. Remember, the less your emotions are controlling your decisions in trading, the better trader you will become.

Reducing your position size will only get you part of the way there - the rest is in your head.
