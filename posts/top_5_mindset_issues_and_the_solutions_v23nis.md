*This post represents the previous two posts on the topic combined and expanded upon.  The hope is that this gives members a single place to go for the topic.*

In most fields, if you take the time to learn a skill, and then practice that skill, you will improve.  This linear progression in achievement provides the entire basis for almost any career.  The more you learn and practice, the better you get.  It is this promise of almost linear progression that drives people to keep "moving up" in their chosen profession.\*

\**Areas that gauge success on physical performance or artistic ability, also requires a certain amount of inherent talent.  For example, no matter how much I practice and how hard I try, I will never be able to play professional Basketball.*

Somethings are easier to master than others, but typically as long as you have a base level of intelligence, achieving success is combination of time and effort.  Becoming a consistently profitable trader is no different - it takes a tremendous amount of time and dedicated effort to get to the point where you can do this full-time.  Unfortunately, if that is *all* it took then there would be far more full-time traders than there are currently.  In fact, I know some extremely knowledgeable traders, people who could literally write books on the topic - but whenever they try to trade themselves, they fail. They just can't do it.

*That is because unless you master the mindset of trading, all of the knowledge in the world won't help you make a profit.*

I am not saying anything new here - This problem is fairly well recognized; there are plenty of books and online videos on the topic. u/anonymousrussb just posted his excellent recap of  "The Daily Trading Coach - 101 Lessons for Becoming Your own Trading Psychologist" by Dr. Brett Steenbarger. And most of you probably have heard of "Trading in the Zone" by Mark Douglas.

*But as we all know, simply reading a book is not going to instantly solve your problem.*

Issues with *mindset* plague us in various areas of life.  Think about a person that is always going on a diet.  Every six months or so you can count on them to come up with some new diet fad they discovered and are positive will work for them.  And just like clockwork you can be sure that a few month later they will be back to square one, or even worse off than before.  It is not that they don't know they have to lose weight, they do realize it.  It is not even that they don't see the negative consequences of not being healthier, they do.  And it is not even that they don't want to put in the effort to change, they absolutely do.  But yet they fail - almost every time.

***Why?***

***Because they haven't dealt with the root cause of their issue.***

If I attach a 50lb anchor to my leg and try to win a race, I am going to lose.  I can change my shoes, warm-up routine, race strategy, etc...as long as that weight is strapped to me I cannot win.

Most people trying to fix the issue of *mindset* do not deal with the 50lb weight - instead they try to fix everything else to make it easier to run with the weight still attached.  But a weight is a weight and until it is removed, nothing else will matter.

A lot of these issues have deep psychological roots and those need to be dealt with by each individual in their own way.  But just know this - **We trade who we are.**   If you are an anxious person, you are most likely an anxious trader, someone who is depressed will generally trade with a lot of fear, etc.

All I can do here is outline the primary issues and offer up some practical solutions that can possibly help.

So in order to really talk about this issue, we must first identify what we are talking about when we say *Mindset*.   There are so many different issues that traders face in this area so I have grouped them into five distinct categories. When you read these be honest with yourself as to how much each impact your ability to be profitable:

**Gambling** \- Whenever you enter a trade for any reason other than objective analysis, you are gambling. Whether you are buying **AMC** because you thought "*Top Gun"* will boost the stock, grabbing **AAPL** calls as "Tech *has* to rebound", shorting **OXY** as "Energy has run its course", or simply hopping on a fast moving momentum stock - *you are Gambling*.

Let's get one thing out of the way up front - some of us are more prone to this issue than others. We all know who we are. A group of people can walk into a casino. For some, their eyes light up as they hears the sounds of the slot machines and the cheers at the crap table - all they can think about it breaking away so they can convert the cash in their pockets to chips. For others it is about the shows they want to see, and where they can go to dinner. And yes, there are some that think, "This is hell, pure hell, when can we leave?"

Gamblers know who they are - they live by the creed that "*money won is twice as sweet as money earned*"(credit: *The Color of Money)*. I should know, I am one of them. And let's face it, sometimes it is hard not to feel like the market is one big casino. You become detached from the money in your account, as if they are chips on a blackjack table, almost feeling like it's not real money.

The problem with this?

When you start treating your trading as gambling, you begin to take unnecessary risks. *Even worse, you start to think that it is all luck* *anyway and begin rooting for your position to go up as if it was a racehorse you just bet on.* **The more you see trading as simply, "gambling" the father away you become from being a consistently profitable trader.**

Gamblers are a very different breed of people from everyone else and unless you are one, it is very difficult to understand the mentality. It is ingrained into a person's *personality.* The drive to gamble is an irrational one. I am a Statistician (or at least I used to be, I am sure today's Statisticians can run circles around me) and I know full well what the odds are for every single casino game, and how they are stacked against me. Doesn't matter. I know the more I play those games, the more likely it is I will lose money. Doesn't matter. I also know that if I get lucky enough to win, I should take that money and run. Doesn't matter - I don't. **Gambling is a form of self-sabotage that has nothing to do with rationality.** We might convince ourselves that we are playing to win, but in reality *we are playing to lose*...as in every gambler is a deep, dark desire to hit rock bottom. *That* is what you must deal with when you apply this mentality to trading. The idea of *hitting singles*, and *small gains* is foreign to the gambler, especially after a big loss when they just want to try to "win" it all back.   Think about how desensitized one gets after losing $15,000 out of a $30,000 account.  At that moment the idea of being satisfied with a $100 profit on a trade is laughable.  The gambler would rather risk the entire $15K for a chance to double it and make back their money than slowly work their way back up one small trade at a time.

You're never going to replace the thrill of a win or the soul-crushing depression of a loss. The dopamine hits after each gamble is like heroin to the gambler, and trying to explain the virtue of consistent/steady gains is like trying to tell a teenager that a nice cup of tea by the fire is better than going out with their friends to a party.

Gamblers might be more fun to hang out with, they might even be more successful as they take more risks in life than most, but they make crappy traders.

**Solution:** There is a strange quirk to every gambler - a quirk that just might be the saving grace they need.  You see, despite the fact that most *Gamblers* will proudly identify themselves as such, they also always try to convince themselves that, they aren't *actually Gambling*. While gamblers know who they are - they like to reframe their activities as anything but....gambling.  Everyone in the casino has some *method* that they believe gives them an edge, go to a Racetrack and you will see thousands of Gamblers with their head in a racing book trying to use the information to defy the odds. The mental gymnastics that Gamblers put themselves through to believe they aren't actually gambling, provides the solution to this issue.   Look at the dichotomy on the WSB sub-Reddit for the perfect illustration of this.  On the one hand they claim they are Degenerate Gamblers and are proud of it.  On the other they go through massive effort to write up extensive DD on their trades in order to "legitimize" them as well.  Gamblers will try to justify their irrationality, they need to have some excuse to make their actions sound reasonable, otherwise they really are just a degenerate.

I have learned one very simple trick  - **stop trying to justify it and just call it what it is - Gambling**.

"Why did you get all those OTM calls on **TSLA**?" - the answer, "Because I am ***gambling***."

Call it what it is.

"Why are you shorting SPY at the all-time high?" - "I'm ***gambling***, that's why."

Doesn't sound so good, does it?

Keep your online journal, and label each one of these irrational plays what they are - **Gambling**. The distinction is easy - Did you have a technical reason to enter/exit this trade or an emotional one? If it is emotional, you are Gambling.  Revenge trading? Just another form of Gambling. At the end of the month add up all the money you lost from - **Gambling**.

And now - here comes the hardest part of this solution - When you have the total amount you lost from Gambling at the end of each month, make a post that says - **This Month I Lost $XX Because I Gambled on Stocks.**

You won't be able to do it, because you will be too ashamed to publicly acknowledge your issue. When you stop trying to hide behind ridiculous justification for your actions, it becomes much more difficult to....justify.  And the best way you can help someone else you see with this problem - *do not let them justify their actions with anything other than "I am Gambling".*

*Another, somewhat less painful solution to use is this -*

As stated above, after one loses a great deal of money the urge is to immediately get it all back.  **That** becomes your goal, and it is an unreasonable one to say the least.  So you need to reframe your goals before doing anything else - because whether you realize it or not, you just took a major confidence hit.  Sure you can blame the market, lack of sleep, some news story that moved the stock, but deep-down you know the truth - ***you fucked up***.  That is a hard truth to internalize, especially when that mistake cost you a lot of money.

So the new goal becomes this - *String together a series of small wins.*  Yes,  small wins aren't going to make much of a dent in the huge whole you just created.  But you will find that after 4 or 5 wins in a row of profitable trades you'll start feeling more confident again.  It won't be easy, you will want to YOLO the shit out of a stock to get back to even - but don't do it.  Focus first on rebuilding your confidence and set that goal - The next 100 trades I will win 80 or more of them.  And make them small - I am talking a few shares, because *you are not doing this for the money*.

***Ok - on to the next issue in mindset:***

**Uncharmed Life -** Most of us, if not all of us, were not born into wealth. Some may have done well for themselves in life, but it is a pretty safe bet that just about everyone reading this hasn't put millions of dollars into an off-shore account to avoid taxes. Which means we *worked* for a living. Nothing was handed to us, and everything we have we *earned*. And we did this in an environment that is designed to keep us from accumulating that wealth. The rules aren't fair and we all know it. What this also means is that our lives have been filled with a lot of disappointment. The other shoe is *always dropping*.

I go over the **Insidious Power of Wealth** here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/tc2x94/the\_insidious\_power\_of\_wealth/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/tc2x94/the_insidious_power_of_wealth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Suffice to say - ***Money makes Money -*** We all know this.  There is a saying that sum this up pretty well:

*The Golden Rule is this....the one with the most Gold makes the rules.*

Over time this mentality becomes fossilized within us. We are constantly hoping things get better, and always afraid we are going to lose what we have. Think about it, when something good finally happens, do you enjoy it, or do you wind up worrying about when shit is about to go wrong again?  In fact, you are most likely surprised when they don't.

When you are wealthy you don't spend your time "hoping things get better", because things *always* get better. Sure they have problems, but it is more like, "Chet lost his license from racing his Lambo again....now how are we going to get to the party tonight?? I guess my driver will have to take us!"

But for everyone else, *life is a struggle*. And how often do you spend you time hoping for something? Whether it is a raise, a promotion, or winning the damn lottery.

Now take this mindset over to trading and what happens? When you're in profit - what your first thought should be is - **"I need to add to this and continue to grow my position"**, but what you actually think is, **"I need to take profits now before it reverses"**. And when your position is in the red, what you should be thinking is, **"Is my money better spent in a different trade than holding on to this loser"**, but what you wind up thinking is, **"It will turn around soon, it** ***has*** **to!"**. See how the two mentalities cross each other? You cut off your winners out of fear, and extend your losers out of hope, because this is what you do in day-to-day life.

People like to say, "Nobody ever went broke taking profits".  Those people are typically broke.  **Yes - you can go broke taking profits - if your profits are always smaller than your losses you will become broke pretty fast!**

***This results in a huge imbalance and why retails trader lose so much money. Even if you think choosing a winning position was a coin flip, most people, over time should hover around even. But they don't, most short-term traders are losing - because they have more faith in their losers than their winners.***

**Solutions -**

**1)** Cut your average trade size in half. Now, the next time your trade is in profit and you think to yourself that you want to take your winnings off the table, you are instead going to increase your trade size to a full position. And every time your trade is on the losing end, and you think "it will turn around", you will reduce your position by half. What is essential is to trade as you normally would (except now you are using reduced trade sizes), and you only increase or decrease your positions when you have those thoughts. So if you went long **AAPL** at $177.78 with 100 shares (and your normal trade size is 200 shares), and **AAPL** went to $178.50, and you think - I should take profits here, instead you are going to double your position to 200 shares, with an average cost now of $178.13.  However, if **AAPL** drops to $176.78 and you start thinking, "It will bounce back", you are going to cut your position to 50 shares.

**2)** Trade Swapping.  This is how it works.  You are sitting there staring at a losing position.  Let's say it is **MU** \- you got 300 shares are $73 and now it is at $71.50, you are down $450 and not happy about it.  You should close the position - **MU** is weak, the sector is weak, the market is no longer bullish - any number of reasons.  Most importantly, **MU** no longer fits your thesis you had when you entered.  And if you weren't in the trade you certainly wouldn't enter it now.  But you can't - something in you doesn't want to take the loss.  So this is what you do - you aren't attached to **MU,** you are attached to the $21,900 you spent on buying 300 shares of **MU**, which is now worth $21,450.  So you are now just going to put that $21,450 into a better position - let's say it's **OXY**.  While tech is dropping (and taking your **MU** position with it), Energy is on the rise with **OXY** leading the way - so you close **MU** and immediately buy 302 shares of **OXY** at $71. Now you have the same pile of money, it is just in a better position than before. Psychologically you did not "close" anything as that money is still in play.

*\*Use your common sense here - obviously if the market suddenly starts crashing, or* ***AAPL*** *just hit major resistance you need to take that into account. After a month of this look at your results.*

**3)** Do the Walk-Away Analysis: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rs9x9f/walk\_away\_analysis/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rs9x9f/walk_away_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

I can not stress enough how essential this is for every trader to do (some members of the sub put together some automated templates for this as well).  This analysis will show what would happen if you had more faith in your trades over time - and if you are picking the right set-ups as shown/taught in this sub, you will find you are leaving a *lot of money* on the table.

**Counter-Trend Trading -** This phenomenon is actually quite different from the others - because it *doesn't mimic real life*. In real life, we tend to go with the trend; if it was 80 degrees yesterday and 80 degrees today, we aren't expecting it to be 40 degrees tomorrow.  We like to bet on the hot sport team that just won 10 of their last 11 games, if we hear on the news that relations with a country is deteriorating we think things will get worse, if we hear that the economy is improving we think it will keep getting better (usually). We live with trends every day, and go with them, trends provide order, structure and predictability to our lives. Even when gambling, we tend to ride a hot streak - we don't get up from the table, do we? In life *The Trend is our Friend*.

Except in trading - in trading people try to do the opposite. **SPY** is at an ATH, great - buy Puts. **TSLA** is dropping? Time to get some OTM Calls! ***We like to think we can outsmart the market.*** We like to think *everyone else is wrong*.

And there is a reason for that - when we are right, it validates our feeling that we know more than everyone else, and have "figured out" something.

Traders with this issue fall into different categories, with most embodying a combination of these:

\- *What Goes Up Must Come Down....* This is the most basic of your *counter-trend* *traders,* they have a very simple philosophy - when something is up **a lot** they short it, and when something is **down a lot** they go long. Pretty straightforward and spectacularly wrong. *Our job as retail traders is to wait for Institutions to make their move and then follow the money (i.e. trend). We* ***confirm*** *we don't* ***anticipate.***

\- *Anecdotal Analysis -* This form of *Counter-trend* trading has the trader believing that the anecdotal information they see in their daily lives can be applied to a larger trend across the national/worldwide marketplace. It is really quite extraordinary when you think about it, but the thought process goes a bit like this - "I haven't watched Netflix in a long time, my kids don't watch it and my friends never talk about it. I used to hear about them all the time, and lately not a peep. Makes sense with the pandemic waning that less people are using it....I bet it is due for a big drop. Shorting it!" Which leads to the next, similar, type of thinking....

\- *Common Sense Analysis -* This brilliant form of trading involves a connect-the-dots manner of thinking that so many people excel at, and looks a bit like this: During the pandemic people used their credit cards *a lot*, many people even maxed them out and now that employment is going up they are going to have to start to pay them back, with a lot of interest. The next earnings for **Visa** is going to be through the roof! Long **Visa!**"

This is coupled with the equally incorrect assumption that it is **"Too late"** and you **"Already Missed It"**

We have all been there - you don't take a trade because you "feel" like the move is already over.  And then you proceed to watch the stock continue on its' trend.

There is a very simple solution to all this - whenever you have one of these thoughts or urges, you need to realize that in order for you to be right, that means you are *ahead* of the *Institutions*. Why? Because if the *Institutions* has already figured out what you just thought, they would have acted on it and it would be reflected in the price.

**Solution:** Before you act on these epiphanies that showcase your business acumen, imagine the following scenario - A Senior Vice-President at Goldman Sachs, let's call her Debbie, is called into the President's office, and they wants to know why the hell didn't they buy **Visa** before it started going up? And Debbie, stammering has say...."Well, even though we have hundreds of data scientists, and spend millions upon millions of dollars for consumer data, we just never figured out that people would be paying off that much debt. I mean, I know Joe, from South Carolina managed to piece it together, but our whole team was stumped!" Because **that** is what you must think is occurring in order for you to be right.

*Anything you might think of, anything you might guess, if correct, is already baked into the price. Period. You are not going to out-think or out-guess these Institutions that spend endless amount of money to figure out the most likely scenarios and then act on them. If* ***Visa*** *was truly going to have a banner quarter, and Institutions knew it, then guess what? They would be buying* ***Visa!*** *Hence, the price would be going up, and you would see it in the charts.*

So just asked yourself - *Wouldn't Institutions already know this? And if so, why haven't they acted on that information?* Unless you can answer those questions - just stick to what you can see, and what you can see is - *in the charts*.

Does this mean *Institutions* are always right, or that they sometimes don't miss things? Of course not. But assuming you can out-smart teams of data-scientists that have access to information you don't, as well as unlimited resources - falls under the mistaken notion that one's opinion is just as good as another person's expertise.

The other solution is this - **Start a Paper Trading account - and for a month every time you feel like Counter-Trend trading, do the trade there.**  That account will only be used for Counter-Trend trades. Every time you want to predict a bottom or top, trade away to your hearts content in the fake account.   Be honest about it, enter and exit the trades when you normally would have and use a comparable position size.  At the end of the month look at your account balance - the amount you lost (and you *will* have lost) is the amount you saved yourself.  That alone should give you pause.

*Buy High - sell Higher. The Trend is your friend.*

**Lack of Confidence -** This is typically a *personality* characteristic - because it is an almost certainty that trading is not the only place you lack confidence. You may *project* confidence to others, in fact, you probably do - but between you, me and the candlesticks, you know that you don't have any. It is the constant second guessing yourself, and your trades - "Did I read the chart right? Did I make the right call?" Saying to yourself, "I'm never going to get this..." more times than you want to admit. Exiting trades way too early because you lost faith in the set-up.

Traders that trade for a living have confidence in their statistics, they know that if they make enough trades, using the right set-up, that they will be in profit at the end of the month. They have confidence during a huge drawdown in their trade that it will reverse, and equally have confidence when they add to a winning position.

But even the best trader will have moments of doubt. A batter can have a .375 average in the majors, but after an 0 for 20 streak, I guarantee you that self-doubt creeps in. For new traders, or traders still trying to reach profitability, the *lack of confidence* can be a killer. After a huge loss you want to give up, and think to yourself, "What am I doing? I am just throwing away my money - I could just put that money into **AAPL** and leave it there instead." You begin to think that you're never going to *get it*, and every trade you make is steeped in fear. When something goes against you it is almost expected, and you are shocked when something actually works out. Even worse is when you finally think you *got it*, only to realize, *you don't have shit*. To make things worse, generally people in your life aren't supportive - which isn't exactly a boost to your self-esteem. If you talk to any former trader that has given up you will find that at the heart of their decision to quit was a complete lack of confidence that they could do it.

**Solution:** Take one month and be meticulous with every single trade - after each one write down the exact set-up you used and the reason you entered (this also forces you to slow down, which is good), as well as the reason you exited. Also note the mistakes. At the end of each day upload these trades to your trading journal and enter in the set-ups & mistakes (try to make sure you keep your labelling consistent). These can even be from paper trading. At the end of the month, find the top three set-ups that have the highest win percentage, and then for the next month, *only trade those set-ups*. Also find the *top two mistakes* and work on fixing them (i.e. exited without a technical reason). This may reduce your total number of trades, which is fine. But the most important thing is to *only trade the top three set-ups.* Continue to enter them into the journal and continue to enter in the mistakes. At the end of the second month see if the percent of time you commit those mistakes has declined, see if your overall win rate has gone up. Keep refining this process over and over until you find at least one set-up that returns a 70% or higher win-rate. Yes, this may take a long time, but you are trying to solve a rather deep issue, and if you don't it will forever remain a roadblock to your success as a trader. Once you have found a set-up that works, you need to only *trade that set-up* for the next month after that. P&L is not important here, reducing mistakes and raising your win rate is the only thing that matters.

If you follow those steps, you will find it will dramatically improve your self-confidence over time.

Obviously there are times when this issue finds its root cause in your personal life.  Much like entering a relationship - if you don't like yourself, how do you expect others to like you? Well, trading requires confidence - you need to have faith in your decisions and set-ups because the market will try every way possible to try and shake you out.  If you find that you have confidence issues in your life, to the extent that they impact your day-to-day - it is best ***not*** to trade until you have a handle on them.

**Over-Confidence -**  Not so ironically you are very similar to the person who *lacks confidence*, you just came up with a very obnoxious defense mechanism. As a *personality* characteristic those that fall into this group are usually that one person in your friend group that has to "top everything" someone else says or does. If they ever bother to ask about someone else's life it is just so they can guide the topic back to themselves in some way. One of the problems with these people is that they do not really know they have an issue - so here is a little guide: If you think you have come up with some new way to "beat the system" and you are not yet consistently profitable every month - you are in this category. If you think this is "easy and everyone else are idiots", you are in this category. If you think you are one "meme stock" away from being rich, you are definitely in this category.

**A simple question to ask yourself - "Are you consistently profitable yet? No...then what the hell are you so cocky about?"**

I see it all the time, people come into this thinking they have it *all figured out*. Everyone else is just an idiot, and if they just followed their basic method (it can truly be anything, from a three-bar system, to volume profiles and pivots, to even "gut feeling") they too can quit their job and be rich. Chances are these traders bought some OTM calls on a stock and got very lucky. Usually I hear stories that average out to roughly turning $3,000 into $30,000 on one trade. Sometimes, they get lucky twice, and that $30,000 becomes $200,000 and they are flying high. Without fail, those traders wind up losing the money they made, and then more on top of it. *If this ever happens to you, and you get this lucky - for the love of god, take that money out of your account now, put it into the bank, consider it a lottery win, and start learning how to really trade.*

This problem tends to be very short-lived because the market shows no mercy to arrogance. Another way this problem manifests itself is in the belief that you do not need to put in the time and effort required to be successful at this. Many people don't want to hear that do this is like trying to excel at any other career, you need to work your ass off. So instead they are drawn to "quick fixes", these are the people that like to believe that one can spend 30 minutes a day trading and be done. The notion of starting at the beginning and slowly building up your knowledge and strategies is a very foreign concept to them. Just consider this - trading for a living offers complete and total financial freedom. You have no boss (except yourself and maybe the market), you control your own destiny. It truly is one of the best jobs in the world. Now think about how hard one has to work just to get themselves into a middle-management position at some company that could let you go tomorrow and not miss a beat. Chances are you went to college, got entry level jobs, worked your way up with various promotions and after many years found yourself in a small office making between $100 and $250K (if you are lucky). Given that, how anyone could possibly think that a few YouTube videos and reading parts of one book is all the work they need to do in order to become a full-time trader, a far better job than just about any other out there?

**Solution**: There is none, these people are a pain in the ass. Seriously, if you are in this group, either you stop being an asshole, or you don't. Because to fix a problem you need to recognize you have a problem - and people in this group *do not think they have a problem*.

Now to be fair - there are some that have this issue but aren't too far gone....yet.  Chances are they are just starting out and want to come up with some automated Algo to trade, or think they have come up with a combination of indicators that has *cracked* the market.  If you are one of these people, do yourself a favor - try to find just *one* other person that can prove they are a consistently successful trader without having put in hard work and time.  Just one.  When you can't you either need to believe *you are the only person in the history of trading that has found the secret way to do this or that perhaps you're wrong.*

Honestly, there isn't much else one can do in this category - these people are annoying as all hell and the only saving grace is that they do not last very long.

So there you have it, these are five mindset issues that plague traders and the solutions.

Any single one of them can supersede all the knowledge you have and make it impossible for you to become consistently profitable.

Without the right mindset (which is another post entirely) you cannot be a *consistently profitable* trader, and with the wrong mindset you will quickly find your account size dwindle down to zero.

Best, H.S.
