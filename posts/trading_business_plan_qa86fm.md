Earlier in the year, I posted my Trading Business plan in the r/Daytrading forum for feedback, [linked here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/n7xkps/trading_business_plan_for_review_feedback/)

At the time, I was very focused on momentum trading and scalping, and fortunately have since found this forum. I had started out paper trading (which meant spending 2 hours at a time using ThinkOrSwim's OnDemand feature to paper trade on the weekends, focused on the first 90 minutes after the open. Here were my results - extremely volatile, but in a clear direction - DOWN!

After putting together my notes on Real Day Trading last weekend [(shared here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/q5wagp/sharing_resource_summary_of_real_day_trading_posts/), I spent some time this weekend re-working my Trading Business plan to reflect the strategy I will be focused on going forward - trading relative strength and weakness vs. SPY, with a longer term trend (daily chart) in line with the direction of my trade.

Here is my plan. I realize it is extremely long - posting partially for my own benefit to help hold myself accountable to it, but welcome any feedback and if you think it's useful, feel free to steal for yourself. 

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Part I: Overarching Framework and Plan**

**Trading Vision:**

By February 2022, I will begin live trading after having established a successful, consistent, winning trading strategy that has been tested through extensive paper trading efforts. 

By February 2025, I will have sufficiently consistent and profitable results from the live trading over the past 2 years to facilitate the transition into full-time occupation as a professional trader. These results will generate on average at least $1,500 per trading day, or roughly $350,000 on an annual basis if executed on a full-time basis.

Why? Because I do not want to constrain my life by working for a company. Professional trading will allow me to generate my primary source of income without being tied to a specific company or location, offering greater flexibility and financial freedom that can be obtained through my current corporate trajectory. 

**Trading Mission:**

Consistently improve trading strategy and discipline over time, while consistently generating profits that enable compounding growth of capital. 

Focus on constantly learning more about trading strategies, execution, and psychology to enable continuous improvement. I will always keep focus on the long-term vision and ensure every week brings me a step closer to reaching that ultimate vision.

**Timeline:**

§ **Paper Trading**

* **May 2021 – May 2021** – Develop initial framework for trading business plan. **Status: Complete.**
* **May 2021 – Oct 2021** – Test out trading strategies and refine trading business plan based on what strategies work well for me in terms of generating consistent results. **Status: Complete – will focus on trading stocks with Relative Strength / Weakness vs. the market and in line with longer term trend (daily chart).**
* **Oct 2021 – Feb 2022** – Execute refined trading business plan to prove concept prior to transitioning into live trading and make any final adjustments to trading plan prior to transition to live trading. **Status: In Progress.**

§ **Live Trading**

* **Feb 2022 – Feb 2023** – Begin live trading, at a minimum of 1x per week (target 2x per week), objective is to show the potential for modest returns but more importantly with minimal drawdowns in trading capital, confirming the consistently of the trading strategy.
* **Feb 2023 – Feb 2025** – After 1 year of live trading, objective is to transition from modest returns to consistent returns that would be sufficient to provide full-time income if done daily.

§ **Professional Trading**

* **Feb 2025 – Onwards** – Refine trading business plan for transition into trading on a full-time basis and then transition into becoming a professional full-time day trader.

**Objectives for Paper Trading**

*Note: This is written for the phase described in the timeline as “Paper Trading”. Once the transition from Paper Trading to Live Trading is made, this section will need to be re-written for the Live Trading phase.*

Will start with an account sized at $30,000 for paper trading, to reflect the expected size of the account that I will start with when live trading.

**Daily / Weekly:** 

There will be no daily or weekly goal. This is because focus should be on win rate which needs to have a sufficient sample size to be meaningful. 

There will be a maximum loss of 3% of trading capital per day from trades opened that day. Once that level is reached, paper trading for the day should be stopped and the rest of the day can be focused on monitoring the markets / other traders or on trading education.

**Every Other Month:** 

Every other month (defined by every \~8 total trading days since I am only trading 1x per week on average) the target will be to generate 10% returns on trading capital. At the end of each month, the following metrics will be analyzed:

* Win percentage – target 75%, excluding all trades with P/L within +/- $25 as “scratches”
* Risk reward weighted by win percentage of at least 2:1
   * Calculated as P&L from winning rates divided by P&L from losing trades with scratches excluded
* P&L – average of 1% of base trading capital per day

**Total:** 

Since this is expected to span across a 4 month period before transitioning into live trading, it is expected that this will be around 25 days in total. The objectives for the total period are:

* Win percentage – target 75%, excluding all trades with P/L within +/- $25 as “scratches”
* Risk reward weighted by win percentage of at least 2:1
   * Calculated as P&L from winning rates divided by P&L from losing trades with scratches excluded
* P&L – average of 1% of base trading capital per day
   * Translates to an end goal of $37,500 after 25 days (will not raise position size unless I reach $40,000, so will aim for $300/day on average)

**At a minimum, paper trading account will need to reach a goal of $35,000 before beginning live trading with a maximum drawdown of $3,000.**

**Part II: Money Management & Trading Strategy**

**Money and Risk Management Principles**

Risk management is **extremely important**. Avoiding account blow up is significantly more important than trying to get rich quick. The objective is to generate consistent results that will provide sufficient confidence in the trading program to eventually go full time.

**Initial starting capital will be $30,000 for both the paper trading account and the live trading account. Additional deposits will not be made in the trading account, it is expected that the account should grow on its own based on trading profits and sizing up in terms of position size will not be done until certain trading capital thresholds are met.**

There will not be a defined “R” or risk per trade with this system. Instead, position sizing will be done to manage risk, and this position sizing will be based on confidence level in trade and volatility of the stock being traded.

Base position sizing will be as follows, based on trading capital. This approach ensures that position sizes are not too large relative to trading capital available while also ensuring that increases to position size only occur when trading capital appreciates (i.e. profits are being generated).

   

**Trading   Capital**

&#x200B;

**Base Position Size**

<img src="cache/images/59bab839c1cc8c56662eff0b1e8115aa.png" alt="Reddit Image">

However, this is the base position size, and this will be adjusted up or down based on the following factors:

1. Stocks with very high volatility (defined by an ATR divided by price above 10% of stock price) or stocks under $10 will be traded with 50% of the base position size
2. Stocks with very low volatility (defined by an ATR divided by price below 2.5% of stock price) will be traded with 200% of the base position size
3. When there is a high degree of confidence in both market direction and the stock being entered, stocks can be traded up to 200% of the base position size, although this is not required and going above 100% of the base position size is always discretionary 

* If this is the case but the stock meets the very high volatility criteria defined by (1.) above, then the stocks should be traded with 100% of the base position size
* If this is the case but the stock meets the very low volatility criteria defined by (2.) above, then the stock should still be limited to 200% of the base position size

There will be a maximum loss of 3% of trading capital per day from trades opened that day. Once that level is reached, trading for the day should be stopped.

**Trading Framework & Routine**

There will be no limit to the number of trades per day, but part of the post trading day activity will be to assess whether overtrading is occurring. This will not be defined by the number of trades taken, but rather by assessing whether the quality of the entry/setups taken degrades throughout the day (or is just poor in general). 

While it’s not a hard target, I would like to target makes 15-20 trades per day on average. At first, the target should be lower to allow for a high degree of focus when executing trades and ensuring that every single trading criteria is met – in the 5-10 trades per day range. 

If overtrading is observed, a maximum number of trades per day can be put in place for a short period to help drive focus on quality of setups, but this will not become a permanent rule.

Trading will not be focused on a specific timeframe. The intent will be to utilize the full trading day, with the following breakdown of time (all times CST):

7:00 AM – 8:30 AM – Pre-Market

* Read the following daily posts to get a feeling for the market and any key overnight events that may be relevant for today:
   * “The 10-Point” from the Wall Street Journal
   * “The Morning Brief” from Yahoo Finance
   * “The Big Picture” on Investor’s Business Daily (IBD)
   * “The Market Trend” on Investor’s Business Daily (IBD)
* Review overnight price action for SPY, QQQ, and all stock(s) with open positions
* Review charts for any stocks on watchlist or those that came up during morning reading
* Review Option Stalker scanner for stocks of interest, specifically:
   * Pre-Open Gainers / Losers
   * Gap-Up / Gap-Down
   * Pop-Bull and Pop-Bear
* Read Pete’s pre-market comments on One Option

8:30 AM – 9:15 AM – The Open

* Focus on watching the market and monitoring the behavior of individual stocks
   * Do not focus on making entries – at maximum, enter 1-2 new trades during this time
* Objectives:
   * Get a feel for market direction based on SPY price action, 1OP indicator, and chat room commentary to set stage for trading the rest of the day
   * Identify individual stocks with Relative Strength / Weakness to SPY

9:15 AM – 2:00 PM – Trading Session 

* Make trades based on trading plan (see next section)

2:00 PM – 3:00 PM – The Close

* Focus more on exiting trades then entering trades
* Make decisions on what stocks will be held overnight, and close the rest

3:00 – 5:00 PM – After Hours

* Review results from the day for each individual trade
* Journal for the day – document how trading went, what mindset was for the day, identify any potential improvements for the next trading session

**Part III: Trading Strategy**

The focus of my trading strategy will be based on the following key principles:

* The majority of stocks (70-80%) will follow the market as measured by SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
   * This applies even if they are not in the S&P 500.
   * This only applies to stocks over $5.00 which will be the focus of this trading strategy.
* Focus will be on going LONG on stocks that have Relative Strength vs. SPY, and going SHORT on stocks that have Relative Weakness vs. SPY.
* Monitoring the market is critical and will dictate trading. 
   * I will not go LONG on stocks when I have a SHORT market bias
   * I will not SHORT stocks when I have a LONG market bias.
   * I can go either LONG or SHORT when I have a neutral market bias, but these trades should not be sized large (see position sizing section).
   * When I am trading in the same direction of my market bias, I can size up to 2x as large as a normal position size (see position sizing section).
* All positions taken will be in line with the longer term trend for the stock (daily chart). By trading stocks in line with the prevailing daily trend (LONG stocks with bullish daily charts and SHORT stocks with bearish daily charts), I will have more staying power in my position and can hold positions overnight as a swing trade when needed. 
* All trades will be **Stock only.** 
   * Only exception: Lottery trades on Fridays (straight calls/puts expiring the day with a maximum position size of $300).
   * Note that options are anticipated to eventually become a very large part of the trading strategy, but only after consistent profitability is achieved, as defined by trading capital appreciation up to $50,000 with no drawdowns exceeding $3,000.

Relative strength and relative weakness will be defined as per the table below:

**Trade Criteria:**

To enter a trade, the following conditions must be met at a minimum.

   

<img src="cache/images/155405c307a7b21efcb80d8b524da581.png" alt="Reddit Image">

In addition to the above minimum requirements, the following factors will make for a stronger trade in general. Most trades should have at least one of these factors met, ideally multiple. 

   

**Long & Short Trades – Additional Factors**

 

<img src="cache/images/41ac9f42824579e7518ade4b1b75a4c1.png" alt="Reddit Image">

In the requirements, trade entry criteria are referenced. It is important that in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for a trade, the timing of the entry should be such that it is upon confirmation and not anticipatory in nature. Therefore, one of the following criteria must be met before entering the trade:

1. Trendline breach:

a. Breach of a downward sloping trendline to the upside on the 5-minute chart for long positions 

b. Breach of an upward sloping trendline to the downside on the 5-minute chart for short positions.

2. 3/8 EMA cross:

a. 3-period EMA crossing above the 8-period EMA on the 5-minute chart, or coming back to and then separating above for long positions

b. 3-period EMA crossing below the 8-period EMA on the 5-minute chart, or coming back to and then separating below for short positions

3. Market confirmation:

a. 1OP cross above after falling below 0 confirmed by technical price action on SPY indicating a bullish market move may be beginning

b. 1OP cross below after rising above 0 confirmed by technical price action on SPY indicating a bearish market move may be beginning

Before entering a trade, the following steps will be taken:

1. Confirm that all minimum requirements are met

2. Confirm which additional factors are met to gauge quality of the trade

3. Wait for trade entry criteria to be reached

4. Define price target, if applicable (may not always have a target)

5. Define stop loss – this is required. If meaningful stop loss cannot be identified within 3% of current stock price, need to size down from normal base position size to ensure maximum loss is less than 1% of trading capital.

6. Define position size. Calculate number of stocks to trade based on position size criteria and stock price.

**Exits**

The following reasons for exiting a trade will be utilized. Whenever one of the below conditions are met, the trade must be exited:

1. Stop loss defined before entering the trade is hit. This will be handled via mental stops.

2. Major technical violation on the daily chart such as breaking a major SMA or horizontal support/resistance level on a closing basis.

3. Hit profit target – these will not always be defined when entering trades, but when they are they must be followed.

4. Thesis no longer applies – if original thesis for entering trade no longer holds (lost Relative Strength or Weakness), 3/8 EMA crossed back against position (if used as entry criteria), need to exit.

5. Market direction changes against trade. Only exception to this is if the position is being used as a hedge against other positions and the overall portfolio is aligned with the market direction change.

6. Earnings overnight or the next morning – always sell before the close, do not hold over earnings.

While not a required exit criterion, positions can also be exited if a time stop in my head is reached or if the stock stops moving as expected, even if it doesn’t firmly meet one of the above criteria.

**Part IV: Everything Else**

Will target the following time dedicated to trading each week:

* Every Friday – full day dedicated to paper trading
* Daily – Review all trades posted by One Option Featured Traders after work
