I'll share my setup, mostly as a starting point if you use TC2000. The important part about setups is that you need to customize them to fit what you need. I've spent countless hours tweaking things to work for me. So take what you want and throw away the rest. Like all tools that are highly customizable: they are best tailored for the individual.

I have three 4k screens: two stacked in landscape, and one vertical. You don't need this so don't rush out and buy this. Just providing for context on how I layout my windows.

**Main Screen:**

There are only two things:

1. main TC2000 window (this is about 60% of a my non-scaled 4k display...)
2. brokers (I use TDA and [Tastyworks](https://start.tastyworks.com/#/login?referralCode=ZWKSPZ94ZG) \- referral link)

**Top Screen:**

1. ETF [layout](https://www.tc2000.com/~jCfhod)
2. SPY/QQQ [layout](https://www.tc2000.com/~g2jdPB)
3. Watchlist/positions [layout](https://www.tc2000.com/~O7jzor)
4. [oneoption.com](https://oneoption.com) \- used for scanning and 1OP

**Left Screen (vertical):**

1. Discord chat
2. 1OP chat ([oneoption.com](https://oneoption.com)) 
3. browser windows
4. tradexchange
5. music

My main TC2000 layout consists of three layouts:

1. watchlists, scanner + linked M5 and daily charts ([layout](https://www.tc2000.com/~2glSDt))
2. SP500/NSD100/HighCap1000 scanner + linked M5 and daily charts ([layout](https://www.tc2000.com/~qNvoFT))
3. sector/industry breakout ([layout](https://www.tc2000.com/~yzCMKa))

u/onewyse pointed out a very cool [strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/xzvnc8/tc2000_multiple_scan_results_on_one_watch_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for using a single watchlist for scanning. I make use of that in my layouts as well. I've customized my columns to search for the things I care about during the day.

u/lilsgymdan also puts out a lot of cool TC2000 stuff, so check him out as well. I know my market RVOL and ATR indicators are based off of some of the things he has experimented with and shared.

Here's a picture of the main layout.

TC2000 is a beast. So hopefully these layouts provide a starting point for you to start experimenting and playing with it to see what works for you.
