I want to touch on a more macro topic here for a moment, one that I think will resonate with a lot of you.

As many of you know from my introduction story, I climbed my way out of poverty.  On my way up the socio-economic ladder I spent time on every rung.  Going from being homeless, to "working class", eventually into the "middle-class", to "upper-middle class", and so on, until I finally made it into the "top 1%".  I am wealthy? No.  Once one gets here you see what wealth *really* is, and it is a completely different world.

While I am not yet at the "Should I buy another yacht or finally get that 8,000 sq ft vacation home in Aspen?" level, I am able to travel in those circles.  Here is what I learned from rubbing elbows with super-rich:

First and foremost - *Wealthy people have an absolute disdain for anyone who isn't wealthy*.  It is important to realize that.  Imagine a person who is homeless, they haven't showered in over a week, they're clearly sick, and look a bit unstable.  I am sure most of you would be empathetic, might even want to give them some money if you saw them on the street - but I want you to imagine they are coming over for dinner.  They come into your house and sit down at the dinner table.  Put aside the "politically correct" answer, and think....How do you feel?  *That is how wealthy people feel about you*.  They think anyone not in the top echelon of wealth as being uncultured, broken, or as so many of them put it, "People who have played the game of life and lost".  They go so far as to refer to people without wealth as "civilians", as if they are some elite guard. Plus, they don't care why you aren't wealthy, because in their minds, you aren't wealthy because *you aren't good enough to be wealthy*.  Simple as that.  Sounds horrible right?  It gets worse.

Secondly - *the system is rigged*.  This is not a shock to any of you.  Here's an actual conversation I heard the other day:

**Rich fucker #1** *"Hey...how much did you wind up paying in taxes last year, I know you were working on getting that down a bit"* 

**Rich fucker #2** *"When it was all said and done I paid around 12% in taxes, totally"* 

**Rich fucker #1** *"12%??  Ok, you need to call my guy, like immediately - 12% is ridiculous"*  

Yes, you read that correctly - the notion of paying 12% on their total income for the year was shockingly high.  Think about that when you are doing your taxes and trying to get it down below 33% all while worried about getting audited because you declared a bit too much on "charitable donations".    There is a reason members of Congress out-perform the S&P 500, or way out-perform the average investor year after year, and they aren't even on the top of that insider food-chain.  

But despite all of this, that isn't the real power they wield...the real power is this - ***They control the narrative***.  

You see, they don't want you to join their club, just like you don't want that homeless guy to sit at your table.  So a *culture* was created, one that just about everyone has bought into - *Be happy with what you have*.  

Ever since you were young enough to understand the concept of money, one thing has been drilled into your head - *the definition of success*.  Sure you might have had a lot of dreams growing up, but eventually they were replaced with something much more obtainable, something noble even - *"Support your family*" *.*  If you can manage to get a decent job, get married, have kids and buy a house, you are a *success.*  **That is what we are taught.**   And don't get me wrong, that is a very honorable goal, and something to be extremely proud of accomplishing.  But you are taught that is the endgame, do not pass "Go", do not collect your $200....game is over, you won.

Notice there is no major in being an *entrepreneur*? No class in High School about *starting a business*?  Instead of telling you to buy stock at the age of 18, you are told to focus on a picking your major and thinking about what job you want to get when you graduate.  Because once you get on the track of depending on a paycheck, they know that is exactly where you will stay.  Always 1 or 2 missed paychecks away from poverty.  And everything is priced accordingly, done to make sure your savings never really add up.  For one family it is that trip to Disney-World, because hey, you deserved it! For another it is finally getting their kid that XBOX all their friends have and it broke your heart watching them go without.  Proportionally it is all the same - at the end of the year, there are no savings left.

And then something happened....people realize a door was left open....Trading.  You can open an account and if you make the right decisions you can finally begin to accumulate some wealth.  You can join their club whether they want you to or not! And what happened?  You were scammed, led astray, given all the wrong advice, but encouraged to *keep trying*.   People were taught to "*hate the hedgies"* and "*damn the institutions*", an idea that those in power were more than happy to encourage. 

So, that is why this sub was formed - to rectify that injustice, and at least give everyone a - ***chance.***  To level the playing field a little bit, and put your destiny back into your own hands.  So that one day, perhaps you'll be able to tell them that, you don't want them to *sit at your fucking table,* and instead you'll help that homeless guy find a seat. 

Best,

H.S.
