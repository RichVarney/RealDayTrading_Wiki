Learning all these rules and methods isn't easy, implementing them successfully is even harder. It takes a lot of time and hard work to get right, and even then the learning never truly ends.

But just when you think you "got it", you start seeing *contradictions*.

**A few scenarios:**

You learned to wait for the pullback to 8EMA, and so you are watching MRNA go up and up and up, and seeing traders go long and making huge profits.  And then a pro trader says, "Oh, in that instance, you don't need to wait for a pullback, stock is strong enough".  WTF?  Strong enough? What is strong enough? How do I measure, "Strong enough"??

*Or there is always the classic:*

You're in a trade and it isn't going your way, the stock is dropping, and it drops below the 8EMA, perhaps even below VWAP, so you exit for a loss. Because that is what the rules say you should do. But the pro trader that you followed into the trade doesn't exit, they hold and two days later they take profit saying, "Yeah I was going off the daily chart for that one and giving it a lot of room".  But just the other day in almost the exact same trade you saw that trader exit the moment the stock hit the 8EMA, and that stock had an even stronger daily chart!  Which of course has them saying, "I didn't like the market so I didn't want to hold overnight".  Once again, WTF.  How does one quantify, "I didn't like the market"??  Is there some secret market metric that pro-traders get together and vote on?

"Hey how many of you like the market right now?  Only 2?  Ok, so I am going to set this meter to - 'We don't like the market'"

And now you're confused and frustrated.  Apparently, sometimes you wait for a pullback, and others you just jump right into the middle of a long green bar.  You should exit a trade when it breaks intraday technicals, but *not always*, because there are times when you should hold that trade for days!

I get it.  It can make you want to throw your hands up, find the first OTM TSLA option you see and go for broke, because why not at this point.

I will try to clear this up -

What you see as *contradictions* are actually a testament to the rule that there is no such as thing as "one indicator" or "one metric".

*Everything is taken in context.   These charts tell a story and it is your job as a trader to read them.*

Much of this confusion comes from the constant refrain of wanting hard and fast rules to follow - almost as if the trader themselves is a walking algorithm.   Much of this is fed to us when we start trading by YouTube videos showing very specific methods (i.e. "...and when the third bar passes the second bar, you enter the trade"), or basic books/tutorials on technical analysis which are simply giving examples.

Should you wait for a pullback to the 8EMA on a strong stock before entering? Yes, *usually* you should - but look at the sector, is the entire sector hot?  Is there a news related reason for the increase?  How is the volume? What is the market doing?  Is the stock so strong that by the time you get a pullback you will have missed the big move?

Now I know where your mind is going:

*How do I know? What is the magic formula that tells me the answer to these questions?*

There isn't one.

You need to stop thinking of things in terms of : *this is where I enter, this is where I should exit, this is where I take profit,* and start realizing that you are watching a constantly evolving story.  The technical indications give you ideas of where the story is going, because the story is being written by *big money*.

**Read the story**.

Volume, Moving Averages, Trendlines, Strength Against the Market - all of these are part of that story.

Think of it this way: Remember any class at school?  For the test there were two ways you could study - you could memorize the facts you needed, or you could understand them.  Whether it was math, or history, or any subject, those that simply tried to memorize never did as well and those that *understood the subject*.  When you are trying to find the exact formula for *Entry* and *Exit* it is the equivalent of trying to memorize before a test.

Which is why so many of you love your annotated 5-minute charts so much, with the "this is where I entered" arrows, but I almost never see those chart combined with daily charts of the stock or charts of SPY - it is as if the stock itself existed in a vacuum.  It doesn't.

*Understand the charts - read them.*

Two examples:

*I entered PFE at 10am on Friday for $54.74, because the daily chart showed a huge gap up after earnings, PFE held that gap and began to build on it over the next two weeks, staying above all moving averages and hugging the 8EMA.  During the period it showed remarkable strength against SPY, seeing some of its strongest days when SPY had dropped. The recent gap up on Friday is from a news-related event that is not temporary in nature (i.e. not a earnings announcement), and it completed an HA reversal on the Daily Chart with heavy volume.  Given the current market conditions and the reason for those conditions, PFE looks to be one of the few safe swings to hold in this market.  Currently still holding the stock, position is down 90 cents.*

*I entered PFE at 10am on Friday 11/26/2021, for $54.74, coming off the M5 bullish hammer and bull-flag, the stock was strong against market, and had heavy volume. I exited for a 50 cent loss at 10:37am when PFE broke consolidation to the downside.*

The first example *tells a story.*  Will that trade work out? Most likely, as it is based on a combination of factors, with sound reasoning behind it.  The second trade is pure technical analysis but no story attached to it.

I would rather be the trader from the first example, even though they are down 90 cents rather than the one in the second example that exited for only a 50 cent loss.

When you go to make a trade ask yourself if you can tell the story of that decision or if you can just defend it based on a set of memorized rules.

We aren't algorithms (yet), we are traders - act like a trader, not an equation.

Best, H.S.
