Let's face it - most people hate to short. The market gives us two ways to make money, but most of us only take advantage of one - why?

When the market is down the first thing a lot people do is look for those stocks that are up, and when the market is up the first thing most people do is look for those stocks that are *really* up.

Now sure, there are some PermaBears out there - and let's face it, they're annoying. Always predicting doom and gloom, raining on your parade.  If you are one of those people just know that you suck the joy out of every room.

Some could argue that one reason we are "short-adverse" is that people simply do not like to root for companies to fail.  But I don't buy it (get it? I don't "buy it"? Clever, no?).  You can't rail against corporate profits in one breath, and then be sad that their stock price is dropping in another.  Virtue signal all you want, but we all know, you don't give shit.

Let's look at the psychological angle of this first - our whole lives we tend to root for things to *go up*.  We want our favorite sport team to score *more* runs, not less. People ask for a *raise,* not a salary decrease. Our brains are hard-wired to want to add things, not substract them.  **More is better**.  

We are also used to prices *going up*.  Things are always more expensive today than they were yesterday - and that is certainly true in today's inflationary environment.   So our seemingly biological imperative to *add things* tends to be reinforced by a cultural one as well.

And then there is the stock market itself - **It. Goes. Up.**  Over time, as a whole, the market rises. There may be dips, sometimes even crashes, but in the end, if you wait long enough, the market always goes higher.    Now while that isn't true for individual stocks, we know that if we went long a random stock and came back in a year, there is a good chance we would have made money.  *But* if we short a random stock and come back a year later, there is an equally good chance that we would be in a world of hurt. 

Which means everything we know from everyday life seems to conform with the way the market operates - shit goes up (except at your job where I am sure shit rolls downhill, which probably why many of you want to become traders to begin with!), and generally, we want shit to go up .

But here's the problem.....*Trading is short-term*.  And *in the short-term* these rules do not apply.  And still, we apply them.  It feels unnatural to short because it goes against our very nature to do so.  

And that is how one begins to get comfortable doing it - by recognizing why so many avoid it and/or do not like it.  Once you realize you're applying a long-term view to a short-term situation, you can begin to push away that feeling of discomfort and truly operate in the moment.  Because operating *in the moment* is what successful traders do, and only one thing matters in that moment - ***How can I make the most money in this situation?***

**Here is a simple exercise to try (use Paper Trading if you want):**

Every day **SPY** is in the *red* after the first hour, find a stock that is down percentage-wise at least 3 times more than SPY and its' own sector.  So if SPY is down .5% you want a stock that is down at least 1.5%.

Once you have that list - find the stocks that are below all three major SMA's on the Daily chart (50, 100, and 200).

Finally - choose only 1 among the ones remaining in the list that have an HA (Heiken Ashi) continuation of at least two flat-topped Red bars in a row.

Now - *Short that stock*. Either short the stock itself, or use a Put Option that has a Delta of .65 or higher and is at least 1 week away from expiration (so not same week).

Do this 10 times and look at your results - 

Best, H.S.
