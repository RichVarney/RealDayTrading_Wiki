EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

The market is going up, up, up. and hopefully many of you were able to make money during this latest bull rush.

Let's start with what you *shouldn't* do right now - **don't try to pick tops**. You might be thinking that the market is going to take a break for a bit and it is time to get ahead of the drop and short SPY. Whenever you have the urge to do something like this just ask yourself this question -

"*Is this strategy based on anything other than my gut feeling?*" If the answer is **No**. Then **Don't Do It!.** Pretty simple. If you cannot find any technical (or even fundamental) reason to think the market is going down, than you need to wait for technical confirmation. What would that be? SPY below 401.50 would be the first technical breakdown. Do not short the market until you see that upward trendline breached.

Now it is possible that your portfolio is overly bullish right now. While Day Trades are generally in cash at the end of the day, many Day Traders also Swing Trade, and given the current market conditions you might be holding quite a few bullish positions (for most of you I am guessing - straight Calls). So what *should* you do? You could *hedge* your portfolio. You are not looking for a long-term hedge here, and you certainly don't want a 1:1 hedge on your positions either. However, VXX Calls are not a bad option (pun intended). Why? Because the rate of decay in VXX has slowed dramatically - meaning even if you are wrong and SPY continues to rise, VXX is not going to drop in equal proportion. However, in a market this strong it will take a fear-inducing catalyst (e.g. interest rates) to reverse it. You could even grab some LEAP VXX calls and sell weekly premium against them to cover the cost if you wanted.

*What else should you be doing?* ***Be Flexible***

To begin with, if you are not familiar with using option spreads to day trade, you need to be. The more tools you have to work with, the more successful you will be at this. For example, on Friday I wanted to trade AMZN early on, but after the initial jump up it wasn't clear which direction AMZN was going. So instead of buying the stock or calls, I used 0DTE Call Debit Spreads. I did one 3340/3345 for a $1 debit and 3320/3325 for $1.50 debit. The moment each went through, I put in an order to sell those spreads for $3 and $4.00 - which would be a 200% and 166% profit on each. Since they were 0DTE I was able to get those credits on both when AMZN took off later in the day. Would have calls been more profitable? Yes, but CDS reduced my risk and freed up capital.

I noticed throughout the day that AAPL was stronger than SPY. Even when SPY declined on the 5-minute chart, AAPL either stabilized or went up. About an hour before the close I was able to get AAPL 132 0DTE calls for .20, which I then sold for .65 about 45 minutes later - a 225% profit. These are called **Lotto** plays, and are best done on Friday's, about hour or two before close.

There are a number of strong tech stocks that I was able to do OTM Bullish Put Spreads on, with expirations 2-3 weeks from now - each spread getting a 25% credit. Because these spreads have the short strike below at least 2 major areas of support, there is a higher than 75% chance of them being successful.

Finally, throughout the day I traded stocks like DASH, FUBO, GPS, AAPL, ATNF, etc. Notice I said, *throughout the day*, meaning not just the first hour. Those stocks all had strength against SPY, so even if the market were to reverse or pause, I knew those stocks would remain strong.

Overall, I used *Call Debit Spreads, Bullish Put Spreads, Straight Calls* and *Long Stock* to take advantage of a very bullish day, I also took some VXX Calls to balance out some of my overnight bullish spreads. I waited for about 30 minutes before I even made my first trade, and finished the day with a closed trade record of 13 winners, 2 misses and 1 scratch.

You need to be **flexible**, every situation is unique and if all you know is buying and short selling than you are handcuffing yourself.

You don't *need* to be in cash at the end of every day just because that is what they say Day Traders should do - that's garbage. If a stock has a good D1 chart with significant support levels, and there is an opportunity to continue taking gains, there is no reason not to hold that stock or spread for the short term.

You don't *need* to make most of your trades in the first hour. *Gap and Go* is a fine strategy but it is not the only one. Most of my best trades actually come well into the trading day, particularly since I have a sense of where the market is going and which stocks are strong/weak relative to that market.

For those of you who are new Day Traders, try this on Monday ***if the market is up again*** (note: these are just suggestions, not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, etc..etc..):

1. Don't trade in the first hour
2. Find 3-5 stocks that are strong relative to SPY - this means that when SPY goes down, these stocks continue to go up or remain flat. And when SPY goes up, these stocks go up even more in proportion.
3. Have the 3 & 8 EMA on your charts, and set the charts to 1M and 5M.
4. After first hour, watch these stocks - wait for them to pull back (the 8 is above the 3 on the 5M)
5. The moment the 3 crosses the 8 on the 5 minute chart (for those of you who like riskier trades, you can use the 1M), buy the stock - *make sure it is still strong relative to SPY*.
6. Sell when you see the 8 cross back over the 3 (if you are on the 5M you make want to take profit before the cross happens and you see a downward trend occurring).

***Also -*** On stocks priced over $100 that are up over 5% on the day, do an ATM Call Debit Spread where the debit you are paying is less than half the distance in strikes (*so if you are doing a 125/130 CDS, there is $5 between the strikes meaning you want to pay a debit less than $2.50*). Set your sell order the moment it goes through to take 10-15% profit (*on Monday's that is the best movement you can expect on CDS'). So if you paid $1.20 for a spread, put in an order to close it for around $1.35 credit.*

Hopefully these two suggestions alone will help show you different ways to take advantage of a bullish day.

Good luck this week!
