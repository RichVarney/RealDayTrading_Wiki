**Reversal Syndrome:** 

This terrible disorder impacts so many innocent traders every year.  

Symptoms typically include:

*Large losses, small wins*

*A constant sense of frustration* 

In its most severe form it can lead to *total emotional breakdown*, usually indicated by loudly announcing to nobody in particular - "**That is it, I'm done...fuck this!**"  

It is a serious affliction that nobody every talks about but needs to be addressed.  How many more must we lose?!?!

So what is it?  What is - **Reversal Syndrome**?

Well, you will recognize it immediately.  In short, **Reversal Syndrome** is the constant belief that whatever position you are in will reverse at any moment.  In essence:

If you are in a winning trade you better get out because we all know that fucker is going to go down soon, right? 

*But* if you are in a losing trade you need to stay in it because you're not going to exit right before the miracle turnaround, are you??

I am guessing by now you know exactly what I am talking about and at its' heart, **Reversal Syndrome** is the core reason why traders lose money.

What is the cause of this? Because, really, it makes no sense.  

Our winning trade means we were right, our analysis paid off and the stock is doing exactly what you had thought it would do. Our inclination *should* be that it will continue to perform unless shown evidence to the contrary.

And in our losing trade it means we were wrong, our analysis was off and the stock is doing the opposite of what you thought it would do. Logically we *should* abort the effort and move on to a trade that performs as we would expect.

But instead, we throw all that out the window and simply focus on one thing - **Reversal**.

One possible reason may have to do with our selective memory.  Consider - We could have ten trades, and in each trade we set a profit target of $1.  In nine of those trades the target is hit. But one time the stock comes right up to the target, within pennies, and then suddenly drops back down.  Trades like that tend to wind up as large losers as we'll hold them far longer than one should.  Each time that happens it leaves an *emotional scar*, such that the memory of that loss (which was so close to being a win) dwarfs any recall of the nine successful attempts.

Over time those *emotional scars* add up and we become more and more fearful.

The opposite is also true.  Many times we will have taken a loss and it turns out to be the right decision as the stock continues to fall. But that one time we took a loss and right afterwards we see green bar after green bar stacked, each one a reminder that if we had just stayed in for another minute we would have been in profit.

Again, every time that happens it also leaves a similar *emotional scar*.  

Because these situations tend to occur much more frequently to those with less experience, those *scars* build up rather quickly.  Eventually it becomes like a reflex.  As our winning trade is going up we don't think, "I can get even more by adding to this!", instead we think, "When is it going to stop?"

Before you know it, you have - ***Reversal Syndrome***. 

The solution to this is discussed at length in the mindset section of the Wiki, but there is one immediate cure you can put into place right now - ***Admit you have it***.  The next time you go to take profit, or decide to stay in a losing trade, just ask yourself, "Am I doing this because I think the position is going to reverse?"  If the answer is yes - then **Stop**.  You need to find another viable reason to exit or remain in that trade *other than* that fear of reversal.  If you can't then remain in the winning trade and exit the losing one.

Hopefully, together, we can all beat this horrible plague before it claims anymore victims!

 

Best, H.S.
