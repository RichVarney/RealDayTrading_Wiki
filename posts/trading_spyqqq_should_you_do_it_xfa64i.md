Ok, let's talk about trading the indexes.  For the sake of simplicity I will use **SPY** as the constant example in this post, but everything here can be applied to an of the other indexes as well, including the interchangeable - **SPX**.

The first thing to get out of the way is to outline the various ways one can trade **SPY:**

**1) Stock -** this is the least common method, but of course one can just trade the ETF itself.  You can buy or short shares - however, they are rather expensive (currently $388.65 - but getting cheaper!).

**2) Options -** One of the most common methods used is to simply buy Call or Puts on **SPY**.  Some people use spreads, like Call Debit Spread or Put Debit Spreads, and others use Butterflies or Iron Condors.  Because the Options on **SPY** are extremely liquid, it is easy to be creative with these. Note that **SPX** Options are typically 10X's the cost of **SPY** options and are based on the index itself.

**3) Futures -** If you are approved to trade *Futures* this is an attractive choice.  You can choose to trade the regular contracts or the micro contracts (e.g. **/ES** or **/MES**).  One of the downsides here are the fees charged, especially if you are trading the micro-contracts.  Since one is usually trading several micro's at once, those fees can add up quickly.  You also need enough margin to trade Futures - I believe right now the margin requirement to trade 1 regular S&P Futures Contract is around $14,300.  Still, futures have no *theta* decay and much high leverage than Options.

**4) Options on Futures -** And of course you can also trade Options on the Futures - it requires less Margin and has a definitive max "loss" as opposed to trading futures directly.

Out of all of these I would say trading straight options on either **SPY** or **SPX** is most likely the number one method used, followed by trading Futures.  

Now that is out of the way - let's get to the heart of the matter: 

*Should one trade the Indexes directly?* 

*And if so, should the Indexes be the only thing you trade?*

My answer is: **No** and **No**. I will explain.

To begin with and I want to be perfectly clear on this - ***I have not seen any evidence that one can trade the indexes in a consistently profitable manner with perhaps a few exceptions.***   The only people I know that can ***consistently*** turn a profit trading **SPY** (or **QQQ**) are professional traders.  Someone like u/Professor1970, u/onewyse or u/OptionStalker are able to turn a profit - but they have practiced and perfected their method over ***years***.  

So let's go through that for a moment - there are several ways one can go about using a method when trading **SPY** (and remember **SPY** is being used here to represent *any* index):

**1) Swing Trading - Overall Thesis:** You could have a long-term thesis on the market.  It may be for the next few days or week, or it could be months or a year out.  One way or another you have come up with your hypothesis as to where **SPY** is heading on a macro level.  While you might take technical analysis into account, there are usually large socio-economic factors that go into your theory.  Perhaps you think the market is currently pricing in a 1 bps rate hike and that it will actually be .75 - at which point the market will jump up.   So you buy Calls for next month.   

**2) Swing Trading - Technical Analysis:** Looking at the daily chart on **SPY** you form your thesis on which direction you think it will go in the short-term.  If for example you note **SPY** has fallen below support and was unable to recover, you might buy *Puts* and hold them overnight. 

**3)** **Intraday Trading - Price Action:** You are day-trading **SPY**, and while you take into account TA in the form of where *Support/Resistance* might be, you are primarily trading the price-action.  

**4) Intraday Trading - Technical Analysis:** You are day-trading **SPY** using TA - which might involve indicators, whether ones that are common place, or proprietary (e.g. the 1OP) - these guide you in trying to figure out the short-term directional moves.

Ok - so there you have it - the various ways you can trade **SPY** and the different methods you can use.  

Looking at those methods, each one requires a substantial amount of expertise.  

For the first one - *a Thesis* \- unless you are a social scientist (luckily I happen to be one) and even if you are, you need to understand that the world's greatest economists try to prognosticate the direction of the market all the time.  ***And they are frequently wrong***.  Safe to say the chance that you will be able to correctly guess, and be right consistently enough to make this strategy viable, is extremely low.  Or to put another way - your armchair musings about the economic state of the world may not be as brilliant as you think.

The next method of Swing Trading using TA is actually the *most* viable of these four as more so than stocks, **SPY** adheres to levels of *Support* and *Resistance* in a fairly reliable manner.  Because of this it is *possible* to be profitable swing trading the ETF - ***However***  (you knew there would be one, right?) - most days are filled with news events and economic releases that happen before the market opens the next day.  In fact, on a majority of the days there is *something* that can impact the market direction before the opening bell. **This alone makes the method of swing trading SPY based on TA too inconsistent to be relied on as a stable source of income.  So it is possible, but not probable.**

Next we turn to *intraday* trading of **SPY**.  

Trading pure *Price Action* is **extremely difficult.**  You need to be very familiar with what you are trading, how it moves, the volume, the directional shifts, etc.  You also need to be watching it, **closely**.  On some days your stop might be extremely tight, and on others is could be very wide - all depending on how the market is moving.    Trend days are very different than Chop days, which are different then Gap n' Go days, etc.  Since there is no "one method" - your ability to be *consistent* rests almost entirely on....*your ability*.  In other words, you need to be **good**.  And not just good, but once again - *consistently good*.   In trading, in order to become profitable, the way you trade needs to be both *profitable* **and** *repeatable.*  Almost by definition, *Price Action* trading is neither, **unless** you are an expert.  Are you? I don't think it is presumptuous of me to think that perhaps you are not.

And finally - *Intraday Trading using Technical Analysis*.   The Professor uses the **Cloud**, Pete uses the 1OP, Dave uses HA Candles and BBandwidth - each of them have their methods.  They have perfected these methods over a long period of time, and are able to form a thesis, look at the technical set-up, *and* read the price-action.  *And even* *they are wrong at times*.  They also do not use *Intraday* trading of **SPY** as their primary source of profit (except perhaps the Professor).

So why not?  Here you have some professionals that are able to do something very difficult that most traders cannot do - *trade SPY intraday successfully*, and yet they don't **only** trade **SPY**.  Not only that - they don't even *primarily* trade **SPY**.  

The reason?  ***Because they can make more money trading stocks with Relative Strength and Relative Weakness***.  

In trading you need an **edge**.  Without it, you cannot be profitable, you can only be lucky.  What exactly is the edge of RS/RW?  To begin with, you need to understand that most stocks *move with* ***SPY*** *-* even if they aren't in the index themselves.  Yes, there are exceptions - those shitty little low-float stocks don't care one bit what **SPY** is doing, but in general if **SPY** drops a lot, most stocks are also going to drop, and if **SPY** goes up, most stocks will go up as well.   Think of **SPY** as the wind on the back of the stock pushing it higher, or conversely in the face of the stock making it difficult for it to move forward.  However, stocks with RS/RW have their own strength, some with enough to overcome that wind or to use it in order to go even farther.  In other words, if you removed the wind altogether, many stock would just be flat, but some will move under their own power.  *Those stocks have Relative Strength or Relative Weakness.*

**Consider this example:**

Stock A is at $150 and up $2.50 on the day. The market is also up on the day, and it is at $391, up $2 on the day.   Around an hour into trading it becomes clear that Stock A has Relative Strength.  When **SPY** pulls back, Stock A continues up.  When **SPY** starts going up, Stock A goes up even more.

You go Long Stock A at $150.  Someone else decides to trade **SPY** instead and they go long on **SPY** at $391.  

*Scenario 1:* **SPY** goes up $1. Since Stock A has RS - it goes up proportionally more - it goes up $1.50. **Winner - Stock A.**

*Scenario 2:* **SPY** is flat.  But since Stock A has RS - it still goes up a bit.  Let's say it goes up .50 cents. **Winner - Stock A.**

*Scenario 3:* **SPY** drops a $1.  Again, since Stock A has RS - it doesn't drop.  It stays even.  **Winner - Stock A.**

Your edge with **Stock A** is that proportional difference.  If you are trading **SPY** and it drops, you are down, but if you were in a stock that had RS, you aren't going to be down as much (you might not even be down at all), or if **SPY** went up, the stock with RS is always going to go up proportionally more than **SPY** did.

There is **no edge** when trading **SPY** directly.  

***But shouldn't I trade SPY to better understand the market?***

**No. That is just an excuse because you are comfortable trading SPY.  In fact, if you concentrate on trading stocks and learning how they move in comparison to SPY, you will not only be studying the market itself, but also how impacts equities.**

When trading you should *always* have a chart of **SPY** up where you can see it - and *always* be aware of what it is doing.  You don't need to trade the ETF itself to better understand it, you need to ***watch*** it.

***Now with all that said, I will be putting together section in the Wiki on how to better read SPY - which should help you when trading STOCKS.***  

It is difficult enough to become a consistently profitable trader - even with an edge.  Attempting to trade without one is a guaranteed way to lose your money.

And the question to anyone that claims otherwise is simple - ***Are you consistently profitable? Meaning do you take out profits every month which goes into your bank account? Do you post your trades on SPY live, in real-time?*** 

Like I said, other than a few people, I do not know anyone that does this and can prove they make a profit only trading the indexes.  

Hopefully you will read this for the warning that it is - stick to trading Stocks.  Once you have mastered that and are a profitable trader, expand your horizons.  

*But until then - we are teaching you how to use an edge - learn it.*

Best, H.S.
