EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

The various forums on Reddit that provide advice and information for traders provide a useful service. You can make connections, bounce your ideas off other people, and learn new strategies from the constant stream of posts every day.

Unfortunately these forums are missing one key ingredient which limits their effectiveness - actual professionals. Despite the constant questions from new traders who wonder, "Can you really make a living doing this??", there is an entire community of traders who live quite comfortably off their profits.

I am one of them, but hey, this is Reddit, anyone can say that. Suffice to say, I also know many of them. Some are more successful than others, but all of them make a decent annual return on their day/swing trading. **And almost all of them avoid these forums like the plague.** Why?

Because of the trolls.

So for identification sake, here are the types of trolls I have seen:

*Basic* \- They are typically harmless, just posting a low effort reply with a singular insult. Comments like, "Idiot", with no context or narrative, just the single world. Easy to ignore.

*Advanced* \- They are a step above your *Basic Troll*. There is some real flair to their insults. The comments are still disconnected from the content of the OP, but they put in some effort. Instead of saying "Idiot", you'll get something like, "You fell out of the Stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down, didn't you?"

*Paranoid* \- This troll will accuse the OP of ulterior motives. Either the poster is trying to sell something or boost their ego, doesn't matter, there is some type of hidden goal. Someone can ask the OP what books/community/chat/video they should read/watch/go to, and if the poster dares to respond with a recommendation these trolls come out in force. They are so angry it is clear that someone, somewhere, hurt these people and now they trust....**nobody**.

*Confused Newbie* \- This person starts off as a confused newbie who claims not to understand the OP's strategy, but no answer satisfies them. Eventually they are asking for proof or quickly turning into a \*Basic\* or \*Advanced\* Troll. OP's everywhere fall into the \*Confused Newbie\* trap but at first they think, "If I just explain this with more clarity, they'll get it". After the fifth attempt they realize that the \*Confused Newbie\* will **never** get it. **Ever**.

*Doubter* \- Armed with some knowledge, these people doubt \*everything\* - no matter what strategy you post, it won't work. They don't know enough to really explain why it won't work, but that doesn't matter. To them - Stranger = Lies. They won't trust anything you say. They'll ask for proof, and if you give it, then the proof itself was "altered". Fortunately, they don't have much staying power. After a comment like, "85% success rate? Yeah, I don't think so, you would richer than Gates if that were true", they don't have much else. Maybe you will get a feeble, "Yeah, not possible" but that's it.

*Incompetent Expert* \- These are by far the worse trolls on these forums and the primary reason real pros stay away. These people claim a degree of expertise in trading and then proceed to outline why everything you said is wrong. The \*Incompetent Expert\* can also combine with \*Paranoid\* making them even more irritating. They typically know the vernacular of trading and to a new trader they can sound like they know what they are talking about. These people will then defend their claims nonstop replying with several paragraphs filled with statistics that attempt to discredit the OP. You want to ignore these people but because their comments \*sound\* intelligent they can detract people from the point you are trying to make. So you argue with them, and down the arrogant idiot rabbit hole you go.

Every online forum has trolls and we all know the psychology behind why they are trolls. Reddit is no exception, and neither are forums dealing with the Stock Market. The problem is that forums like these \*need\* professionals on it. People who truly make their living in the market are an invaluable resource. When they are offering up their time to give advice, it is a positive to the whole community. Sadly, what these forums are left with are people that couldn't even trade for supplemental income, let alone as the primary source.

Anyway, use this guide, know them when you see, and don't encourage them.
