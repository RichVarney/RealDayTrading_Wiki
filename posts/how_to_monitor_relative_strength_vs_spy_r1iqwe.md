I keep seeing the question - How do I get a Relative Strength vs. Spy indicator?

If you do not know what Relative Strength vs. Spy is then read this:

Note that is not **RSI**, which in my opinion is an utterly useless indicator that most people drop after their first year of trading.

But to answer the question - *it isn't easy.*  

Most platforms, whether it is ThinkorSwim or TradeStation, or any other, do not have this metric.  What they have is a simple correlation between SPY and any ticker.  That doesn't really cover it.

The most straightforward way to do this is to just map **SPY** over any chart you are looking at, and every charting software platform out there has this capability.  You can then visually see how SPY and the stock you are watching are moving together.  

As far as I know, only *OptionStalker* as a platform gives an indicator for Relative Strength, but that isn't to say you can't build one yourself.  Many people have built custom RS indicators, and have posted them in this sub - some are better than others.  

You need to not only take into account the difference in movement between the two (SPY and Stock), but also the ATR of both, the volume at the time, the proportional rate of movement/stock price, etc.  Obviously if SPY moves up 50 cents, and a $30 stock moves up $5 in that period, it is different than if a $300 stock moves up $5 during the same time.  If SPY drops 50 cents and a $30 stock moves up 30 cents, that is different than if during the same time a $300 stock moves up $3, even though percentage-wise they are the same.   

However, if you read the theory behind Relative Strength, there are ways to come up with a decent enough list of stocks (a list that should constantly be changing and updating throughout the day) that you can then look through their respective charts, with SPY mapped against them.

Hopefully this somewhat answers an oft-asked question!

Best, H.S.
