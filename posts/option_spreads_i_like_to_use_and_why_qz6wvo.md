For those of you that still haven't wrapped your head around the concept of "options", please read this post first:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pn1rch/options\_trading\_explain\_it\_like\_i\_am\_five\_years/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pn1rch/options_trading_explain_it_like_i_am_five_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

For everyone else, here is a quick guide to some of my favorite Option Spreads -

Options, by design, give you the ability to create various combinations, which when executed properly can give you an edge in different trading scenarios.

Every spread is either done for a **Credit** or a **Debit** \- neither of which are inherently bullish or bearish but rather dependent on the combination you choose.  

**Note: All of these spreads require a corresponding daily chart that support the direction of the position (except for the Bracketed Butterflies).**  

While I tend to use straight calls or puts, spreads can be *very effective* in specific situations.  When buying straight calls or puts, I tend to buy ones that are *In-The-Money* (delta of .65 or higher), and at least 1 to 2 weeks out from expiration (i.e. not the same week).  If you are hung up on Out-of-the-Money Options, please read this:

*Also note - I only do Naked Puts (i.e. selling a cash-secured Put) if* ***I want to own the stock***.  For example, if I really want to buy **PFE** because I like the long term prospects of the stock, but I am only willing to buy it at $50, I will sell the $50 Puts and ***hope they get assigned.*** 

***Here are some of the most common spreads I use:***

***ATM Call Debit Spread:*** 

This spread offsets the cost of a bullish Call by selling another Call option at a higher strike for the same expiration date.  The range between the two strikes represents your potential upside, while the debit is your maximum loss.    For example:

Let say you are bullish on stock XYZ which is currently at $200, and you want to buy a call option.  You don't want to buy a call expiring this week because if the trade turns against you then it would be difficult to hold the Call overnight with time decay rapidly accelerating.  However, the In-The-Money calls for next week and further out are really expensive.  The IV on the stock is somewhat high, and you also don't want to be paying a lot of additional premium.  By now you should know that using Out-Of-The-Money Calls is an ill-advised strategy - so what should you do? 

In this case you can do a **Call Debit Spread**.  Call-Debit-Spreads typically expire the same week because it difficult to collect any real gains on them otherwise (I will explain why).

I prefer doing ATM CDS' (Call-Debit-Spreads), but once you get the concept you can choose how you want to use it.  Sticking with the example, you buy the $200 Call Option that expires this week and sell the $205 Call (also expiring this week).  The $200 Call costs you $5.50, and you get a credit of $3.25 for selling the $205 call - meaning the entire spread cost you $2.25.  

*Just imagine it as a transaction at a store, you walk in and take the $200 strike call off the shelf, and it is going to cost you $550.  But in your pocket you have a $205 call option.  So you go to the register, they say you owe $550, and you first sell them the $205 call you have.  They offer $325 for it, and tell you that your remaining balance for the $200 call is now $225.*  

**Important:** *You want the overall debit to be no more than 50% of the distance between strikes, in this case there is $5 between the strikes ($200 & $205), so you shouldn't pay more than $2.50.*  

Essentially you are offsetting the cost of the $200 strike with the $205 strike.  If the stock moved to $207, at expiration the $205 strike you sold would be worth $2 and the $200 strike worth $7.  Since you are short the $205 strike, that is $7-$2 = $5 profit, minus the original debit of $2.25 for a total profit of $2.75.  

**ATM Call Debit Spreads - That Expire Same Week** for less than 50% of the difference in strikes is an effective strategy to use for either *Day Trading* or *Swing Trading*.  This method allows you to participate in the upside of a bullish stock, while having a degree of protection with your potential loss contained to the debit you paid.    

As these spreads get closer to expiration, the differential in premium between the two strikes will reduce and potential ROI increases.  This is why it isn't advisable to do these spreads with more than a week to go on expiration.  

Now if you are *very* bullish on a stock, you would want to take ITM Calls that are more than a week out in expiration, and so you don't cap your upside with a **Call Debit Spread**.  

***ATM*** ***Put Debit Spread:***

These are the opposite of **Call Debit Spreads** but very similar in intention and execution.  You are buying a Put option, and then selling a Put at a lower strike, which results in an overall debit (as you pay more for the Put then you get for the one you sell). 

This is a *bearish* play, much like a **Call Debit Spread** is a *bullish* one.  Also much like a **CDS** these work well when you do them *At-the-Money*, with the expiration *that week*.  

For stocks that you have a *strong bearish* outlook you may favor straight Long Puts as not to cap your upside, but many times it is far safer to do a **PDS** which will cap your loss.  

***For both Put Debit Spreads and Call Debit Spreads you can widen the distance between the strikes to increase your upside based on your level of directional bias.  So if you are looking at a $300 stock, and you are very bearish, you could do a $300/$280 PDS which gives you $20 of potential upside, minus the debit - which, as always, should be less than half the distance (in this case, it would need to be under $10).***

*These spreads can be Day Traded with the following rule - On Monday look for 10-15% return, so if you paid $2 debit, you want to get a credit back between $2.20 / $2.30, Tuesday you want a 15-25% return, Wednesday should be 25-35%, Thursday is around 35-50% and Friday is 50% and higher.  You can put the order in at these levels right after executing the trade, and you will find that many time you'll hit your target within the same day.*

***Bracketed Butterflies:***

By far this is the most complex and difficult play to make, probably in all of options.  As far as I know, I am one of the only traders that uses this strategy.  

To begin with I will explain **Butterflies** \- in this strategy you are choosing a price you believe the stock will be at on expiration date.  Let's take **TSLA**, and you think that **TSLA** will finish next week at a price of $1,200, with a +/- of $30, meaning you believe the stock will be somewhere in the range of $1,170 and $1,230, with $1,200 as the midpoint.  

Usually **Butterflies** are executed At-the-Money as a neutral play with a high pay-off, but that is *not* how I am using them.

In this case, I would buy one $1,170 call, sell 2 $1,200 calls, and buy 1 $1,230 call - for a 1170/1200/1230 Call Butterfly.  This entire trade would cost you $3 right now.  If I bought 5 Butterflies, it would be $15 (or $1,500).  If **TSLA** finished at $1,199.99, the spread would be worth $2,699 - a 9 to 1 return.  Why?  Because at $1,199.99 - the $1,230 call would expire worthless, the 2 $1,200 calls you sold would expire worthless, but the $1,170 call would be worth $29.99 = $2,999.  Minus the $300 you spent on the spread, and your profit is $2,699.    The closer you are to $1,200, either up or down, the more you make.  

But what if you don't know if **TSLA** will go up or down? But you *do feel it will move a lot in one direction or another?*  

In that case, you would add *another* **Butterfly**, except this time a bearish one.  

Buying the $1,110 Put, selling 2 $1,080 Puts and buying the $1,050 Put, gives you a 1110/1080/1050 Put Butterfly, which would cost a debit of $2.88.  If **TSLA** finished the week at $1080.01, you would get $2,711.  Why?  Because the $1,050 Puts would be worthless, the two $1080 Puts you sold would be worthless, and the $1,110 Puts would be worth $29.99.  $2,999 minus the debit of $288 = $2,711, which is 9.4 to 1.

Doing both of these **Butterflies** together would cost $5.88 ($588 per contract).  

If either **Butterfly** comes close to the target number, either on the Puts or the Calls, you would make a significant profit per contract.  Many times when I do these the stock is so volatile that I can take profit on one Butterfly, and then let the other ride as the stock reverses.  

*You need to monitor these closely.  I will usually put in an order for 200-300% profit for each right after I make the trade.  This type of play works best on stocks like* ***TSLA, GOOG, AMZN*** *that tend to move a lot in both directions depending on the market, which allow you to profit on both sides.  They always expire the same week as Butterflies do not generally pay off until the final week anyway.*

***Fig Leaf (Leveraged Covered Calls):***

This is when you buy **LEAP** calls (meaning they expire at least one year out) on a stock you have a long-term bullish outlook for, and then sell calls against it each week or month.

As an example, if I think **NVDA** is going to continue going up over the next year, I would buy the January 2023 300 Strike Calls (Delta of .67) for $79 ($7,900), and then each week I would sell the call with a delta of around .10 (for 11/26 that would be the $360 calls), which for this week would net me roughly $100.

Essentially this spread would bring in roughly $100 a week in income, plus whatever profit I would be getting from the increase in value on the LEAP call.  

This type of spread is most effective with stock that offer higher premium, but that also comes with downside of volatility.

If **NVDA** ever finishes the week over the value of the short call (i.e. finishes this coming week over $360), the two calls would be exercised against each other - I would buy **NVDA** at $300, and sell it at $360.  Because the $300 call would have increased in value significantly by the $30 gain this week, the spread would be highly profitable.  

The risk on these plays would be if **NVDA** dropped significantly and then did not recover.  

**Fig Leafs** are best used after a market dip, and then confirmation that SPY has found support and is beginning to rebound.  

Stocks like **AMZN, GOOG, NVDA, HD, etc.** are best for this strategy, and offer excellent opportunities for passive income.

***OTM Put Credit Spread:***

I have written on these before, but for the sake of having everything in one place:

A *Bullish Put Spread* by definition is executed when you sell a Put option and then Buy a Put Option at a lower strike price for the same expiration date. An example:

**Stock**: XYZ

**Current Price**: $200

You Sell the $200 Put (expiring 11/5) and Receive $10 in Credit

You Buy the $195 Put (expiring 11/5) and Pay $9

**Total credit** = $1 (i.e. $100) per contract

Simple enough - you received more money than you spent, so you get a credit for the trade. Also if you were to just Sell the $200 Put Contracts naked, not only would that be very risky, but it would take up a significant amount of margin. By adding the long of the $195 Puts, you have capped your loss to $5 a share (minus the credit received).

There are three potential outcomes to the trade:

**Stock XYZ finishes the week above $200**: In this case, both the 200 Put you sold and the 195 Put you bought expire worthless. Thus, you keep the entire $100 credit per contract.

**Stock XYZ finishes the week below $200 but above $195 - Let's say $196:** This is the riskiest outcome with these spreads, as your $195 Put expires worthless, but your $200 Put is worth -$4. You would owe $400 per contract minus the $100 your received in credit = net loss is $300 per contract. The risky part is if you do not close the $200 Put before expiration it will get assigned.

**Stock XYZ finishes the week below $195 - Let's say $190:** This represents a max loss scenario for the trade. Your $200 Puts are worth -$10 and your $195 Puts are worth $5. The broker uses one contract to cancel out the other (i.e. exercising $200 Puts means you are buying 100 shares of **XYZ** at $200 a share, exercising the $195 Put means you are selling **XYZ** at $195 a share - total loss of $5 a share, minus the $1 credit = net loss is $400 a contract (which is your max loss here).

Now that you get the idea behind it (hopefully), here is the twist on this method:

Under certain market conditions you can create these spreads with the right combination of *probability of success* and *ROI* on the trade to execute a strategy that has the highest chance of building your account.

What are those market conditions? You need a pullback in **SPY** to begin with - much like we had at the end of September/Early October. Next you need to see **SPY** recover to the point that you have confidence we have returned to a bullish pattern - October 18th would be a good example of this, second day in a row where **SPY** opened and closed above the SMA 50.

Next you need to find strong stocks, with bullish daily charts that doesn't have earnings for the next 3-4 weeks. Look for stocks that are above their SMA's 50, 100 and 200, and have HA continuation candles on the Daily chart. *I stress again - make sure there are no earnings announcements for at least 3-4 weeks.*

Now you want to find your short strike price (this is price you will be selling your short Put). You are looking for a price that has at least two major areas of support above it. You are trying to get as close as you can to the current price, but still far enough away that you would need a significant drop to occur in order to endanger your spread. 

Stocks do not just drop below their major support lines without a significant technical breakdown in either the market or the stock itself, and the likelihood of that happening within a 3-4 week timeframe is very slim.

Next up is the credit you need to receive for the trade. You are looking for 20 cents credit for every dollar between the strikes (or 10 cents for every 50 cents between the strikes). You will find there is not much difference between doing a $210/$205 *Bullish Put Spread* for a $1 Credit or a $210/$207.5 *Spread* for a .50 cent credit. Both scenarios give you a ***25% ROI*** on your money. Meaning in the $210/$205 Spread you are putting up $4 in Risk to make $1 in Profit. Normally, this is not a good deal for you, right?

*Here's the kicker*: as long as your spread has a win probability of more than 80% you will make money. If you did this trade 100 times and it worked 80 times - you made $80 (+$1 per win), and it didn't work 20 times (-$4 per loss), you lost $80 - breakeven. So you need to be successful more than 80% for this play to be worth it. The 20 cents credit per dollar in the spread figure is calculated because if done correctly these plays work 95% of the time, more than enough to be very successful with the method.

In order to get that type of credit that far out-of-the-money you will usually need to go 3 to 4 weeks out.

Remember, time decay is key to these spreads - every day that passes where the stock price stays above the short strike price, these options are losing value (which is a good thing in a credit spread). The closer you get to the expiration date the faster Theta does its job.

**MU** is a perfect candidate here - the stock is currently at $83.03.  Earnings are on 12/20, so you want a spread that expires before that.  Looking at the chart, anything below $78.90 offers to really good areas of support - the gap up and the SMA 200.  The 77.5/75 spread would give you even more of a cushion.  Right now, the 12/17 expiration gives you a .50 credit for this spread, which is exactly what you need to reach your target ROI.  In order for **MU** to fall below the SMA 200 and the head into the gap, and then even fill the gap - there would need to be a significant breakdown in the either the market or the stock or both.  **Very unlikely**.   

In 2020, we did over 300 of these spreads with a win rate above 96.5%. 

Let's say you took the **MU** spread . The stock can drop $5 a share and your spread still makes full value. The stock can stay right at $83 and your spread still gets full value. Or the stock can go up and your spread still gets full value.

The only way your spread gets into danger is if it dropped more than $5 a share, broke through two levels of support, and remained below $77.50 on expiration day. However, even if that happens, this method is designed with a parachute - *legging out*.

Keep in mind, *legging out* of *Bullish Put Spreads* is dangerous, and need to be done correctly - if you are new to this, or somewhat unsure of how to *leg out,* it is better just to take the loss, but, for the sake of being comprehensive, here is how:

Let's say you get unlucky, and it is one of those 5-10% of the times that the stock or the market has a major technical breakdown before your expiration date and **MU** is experiencing a significant drop. If **SPY** is in the red and your stock is falling below your short strike, you can buy back the short strike and let the Long Put run until you match the price you bought back the Short Put. What would that look like? Something like this:

On the week of expiration, **MU** drops to $80. You are getting a bit worried, but it is Monday and you are still $2.50 above the short strike. On Tuesday the market opens lower again, and **MU** remains weak, now dropping to $79. You are hoping support holds - but suddenly you see **MU** break support and fall below $77.50.

In that case, you can either close the trade for a loss (most likely of roughly $1) This means even though you took a loss, you did not take the full loss of $2 that you could have taken.

Or you can buy back your short strike of $77.5 for probably around $3 and now your Long Put of $75 which is worth most likely worth $1.50 should continue to go up in value as **MU** drops. This is why it is important that you have both a weak market and weak stock. Because if the market and/or stock reverses, and **MU** stops dropping, you risk losing both the $3 you spent to buy back the Short Put and the $1.50 in value of the Long Put taking your max loss from $2 to now $4.50. However, if you time it right - you can put in a sell order of the Long Put ($75) for the same price you bought back the Short Put - $3. If you hit that target than the two will cancel each other out and you get the full value of the trade - $.50 per contract. Obviously you need to monitor this closely - if you see **MU** (in this example) drop more and the $75 Puts are worth $2.50 now, but the stock finds support and begins to rebound, you might want to close the trade, take the .50 cent loss on the difference.

***Calendar Spread with Calls***

In this spread, you would sell an OTM call and then buy the same strike call that expires further out in time.

For example, let's say that I am bullish on **PFE** long term, but I am either bearish or neutral in the short term.  In that case I might sell the 52 call that expires this week and buy the 52 call that 12/3 and buy the 52 call that expires on 12/31.  The idea here is that the 12/3 call will expire worthless with **PFE** remaining below 52, and then stock will start rallying into the end of the year, thus increasing the value of my 52 calls on 12/31.  

You can also buy a call at a higher strike than the call you sold, which indicates a short-term bearish/neutral and longer term stronger bullish position.  This play also works with stocks that are subject to sector rotation.  For example, a stock like **PLUG** or **BLNK**, when the sector is cooled off, you could do this type of spread with some confidence that the underlying will heat back up before your long call expires.

Hope these help your trading!
