Many of you have already read **The Insidious Power of Wealth** (if you haven't, here's the link: [The Insidious Power of Wealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/tc2x94/the_insidious_power_of_wealth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ) which gives a macro-level view of the disparity between the wealthy and everyone else. 

In this post my hope is to piss you off even more by talking about some of the specifics advantages given to those that need it the least. 

**To be clear - I am not opposed to wealth.  Nor do I think there should be a penalty for earning significant amounts of money.  If you earned it, you earned it.**  

**However, I despise when things are imbalanced.**  

Everyone should have the same opportunities.  If you screw it up, that's on you.  

As I noted in the previous post, while there is no *conspiracy* or *cabal,* there are many built-in advantages that help the wealthy stay...wealthy.  Conversely there are also many built-in roadblocks that make it extremely difficult for someone to breakaway from paycheck to paycheck dependence (many of which is discussed in the other post). 

I wanted to give you some specifics so you can get a real sense of those advantages.  Here are some that I have experienced personally, and I certainly wouldn't consider myself *wealthy,* well-off, yes, but not *wealthy*.  So if I have these advantages, I can assure that they are just the tip of the iceberg: 

Let's start with **HKD** \- I was able to short **HKD** on 7/29 -205 Shares at an average price of $434 - I made $67 per share on that short.  On August 1st, I got a call telling me there was another 97 shares available if I wanted to short again.  I passed on that second offer.  Right now the stock is at $585 - imagine how many people shorted when it was over $2,000 and are now up $1,500 a share.  How is this possible? Well, the only way one could have access to that type of trade would be to have a "desk" at a major institution like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan.  That gives you a *personal broker* \- and depending on the size of your account that broker can either be one of their top executives or someone more entry-level.  Although even their entry level contact is going to have a hundred times more power than whomever you will get on the phone at Ameritrade. 

Ok, so I was able to short **HKD** but stocks like that are dangerous, right? Sure I had the opportunity to take that risk, but I could have also fallen on my face - splat.  I mean, what if you get trapped in a trading halt??  

Ha....trading halts!  You think a trading halt is going to worry someone with special advantages?  Hell no!  Because they can just do a **Halt Swap**.  Let's say I shorted **HKD** at $1,800 and it is currently at $600 - great, I am up $1,200 a share!  But then it starts to surge back up, and in a blink it is at $1,100 - halted.  Shit!  What if it opens over $1,800??  No problem - a simple phone call (which gets answered immediately) - "Hey - see if someone will close me out at $1,200 right now".  Five minutes later you get a call, "I got someone offering $1,300 - you want it?" Done.  You are out with a $500 profit.  **HKD** opens at $1,850, goes to $2,300 and you short the damn thing again.  

How else could they reward risk?  Remember high reward trades are only as dangerous as the amount of risk they pose.  If I could buy an Option at $10 and there is a 90% risk of it going to 0 then I need a 10% chance or higher than it will go to $90 for it to be worth it.  But what if I lowered that risk level to 80%, now I need a 20% chance it will go to $40.  Huge difference. 

For example, if decided to buy some ITM Calls on **MELI** that expired on 8/5, and I got them right before earnings - that is a *huge risk*.  And then **Bam!** earnings comes out and **MELI** is up $160 *after-hours* !  But I am worried.  I've seen stocks jump after-hours only to tank the next morning.  What do I do?  Well, normally there isn't much one can do other than wait and hope that when the bell rings the next morning you can close out that position for an insane amount of profit.  *Orrrrrrr* I could decide I don't want to take that risk and I call up that friendly broker saying, "So I got these calls at $55, if this price holds they'll be worth around $140 tomorrow.  Tell you want, I will offer them up right now for $125, let me know if you can find any takers."  Five minutes later, ring ring - "Hey - couldn't find anyone to buy those options but we like it, so **GS** will take them off your hands at $125."  Deal, done.  I make $60 (i.e. $6,000) per contract.

Sticking with Options - Let's say I short **TSLA** and use options - I buy the 8/19 $900 Strike Puts - And on Monday **TSLA** drops because of some stupid tweet by Elon. Those options are up around $40 a contract right now and I am feeling great.  But hey, I'm greedy - let's see if I can get more.  Ugh...bad choice.  A report comes out that **TSLA** is going to exceed their numbers and the stock soars....my option is now toast.  It goes from being up $40 to down almost 80%.  I'm screwed right?  Nah...cause I was able to get **LookBack Options**!  These are one of the many "*exotic options*" that the geniuses in *financial engineering* came up with in their "*Fuck'em All*" lab.  Basically it means that on the expiration date I can choose when options were worth the most, and decide to cash them in at that price!  And you were worried! 

How about **NVDA -** they have earnings coming up - a **LookBack** Option does me no good if I choose the wrong direction, right?  Once again, no worries - I will simply get a **Chooser** Option -and select the $185 strike on 8/26.  If earnings comes out and **NVDA** tanks - drops down to $140.  Great!  I choose my $185 strike option to be a **Put**.  And if **NVDA** crushes it and soars to $230. Once again, not a problem - my $185 Strike option is now magically a **Call**.  *I get to choose after the fact*. 

Moving on - Let's talk about *insider trading* for a moment.  I am sure many of you have seen the statistic that members of Congress historically out-perform the S&P 500?  In fact, not only do they beat the average returns of the market, they are so good that if you grouped them together they would exceed the returns of the best Investment firms.   And sure there are websites where you can see what they are buying and selling, but that information is released about a month after the fact.  It has to be *Insider Trading,* right?  Well....yes and no.  You see the rule states that you are not allowed to use any information that is not available to the public.  It is intentionally *very vague.*  In fact, it is really difficult to actually get charged with this crime. Consider the following examples: an Institution commissions a huge research study - they survey 20,000 consumers and ask the same questions the CPI is measuring.  Well, that Institution would have a really good idea of what that CPI number is going to be before it came out, wouldn't they?  Now let's say they spent $100K on that study and then make the results available for purchase - at the low low price of $75,000.  Ten other Institutions buy the study from them (resulting in a nice profit of $650,000 btw).  Technically that information is available to the public - you just have to pay for it.    

Back to **NVDA** for moment - Goldman Sachs has an entire team on that account.  That team compiles historical information, has connections to lobbyists to get insight on when the CHIP bill was going to be passed and signed - and *rumors* are not consider *factual* information and thus do not generally apply to *Insider Trading* rules - so they didn't ***know*** that Congress had the votes to pass that bill before the news story broke, they just had ***rumors*** that it would. Plus, they have upper management of **NVDA** on speed dial and are able to get a sense of what's happening inside the company as well.  On top of that, they are able to build extensive statistical models that can project the price movement of the stock within a range of likelihood.  Now, that surely gives *them* an advantage over there at GS or JPM - what about lil' ole me? Well if I wrote an email that simply said, "Hey can you send me the **NVDA** report for this week?" Five minutes later, again like magic, there it is in all its PDF glory.  Insider trading? Nah...not *technically*. 

But what if I am a total idiot when it comes to trading?  I have all this access but don't know what to do with it?  Not a problem! *Because when you have money there aren't problems, only people that solve them for you.*  That just takes another email - "Can you send me your trade suggestions for this week?" Bam - there it is, another PDF filled with their top ten trade ideas for the week.  *Sell this Put, Buy this Call, Use this Spread, Avoid this Stock, etc.* 

*Btw - it should be noted that shorting* ***HKD*** *is the only time I availed myself to any of these advantages.  As you can see in the Challenges and the trades I take - I prefer to make my money the old-fashioned way -* ***fairly****.* 

I already mentioned to you the tax advantages, but they are worth bringing up again.  While *Trader Status* is available to everyone that meets the criteria, having a good accountant (or team of accountants) is not something the average trader can afford.  I can't remember the last time I paid over 20% overall on taxes, and that would be high number.  Many of the people I know would be shocked if they ever paid over 10%.  So now only do they get to make more money, they also get to *keep* more money.

Like I said - ***Tip of the Iceberg***.  Imagine the access of someone with ten times more money.  How about 100?

Angry yet?  You should be.  

While these advantages do not stop **you** from making money, they do make sure those with *wealth* get *wealthier*. 

All you have is - your brains, your computer and whatever tools you were able to afford - maybe a good journal or scanner, perhaps a decent charting program and then perhaps a few thousand dollars in *ThinkorSwim.* 

This is why we *follow* the money and don't go *against* it.  This is why it is so crucial to use every possible advantage you have to get an edge.   **Getting to financial independence is the first step.**  

You will never be able to build wealth with a paycheck - in fact, the entire system is designed to make sure you don't.  So aside from starting your own business (and Trading is very much doing just *that*), this is one of the few ways you can break free of the endless financial cycle that traps so many of us.  

It is one thing to be financially smart - save your money, invest wisely, retire early and not have to worry.   Doing that usually means sacrifice, living below your means, skipping those vacations, etc.  And *it is the smart thing to do*.  Of course the only problem is that by the time you are able to finally stop working you're now 65-70 years old. And are you wealthy? No. Are you even rich? No, again.  You most likely have just enough to live comfortably without having to work.  

But why settle for that?  Because that is what we are told to do?  There is an opportunity here and now - and it is a *learned skill*.  The best place to put that all that anger is to transform it into ambition. **Trading is the gateway to financial freedom.**  

They say if you can't beat them, join them.  Well, I will tell you that you sure as hell can't beat them.  And they sure as hell don't want you to join them.  But that part at least is not up to them.  That part is up to you.  This sub is here to give you a roadmap - I hope you all follow it, and in doing so, level a very unfair playing field.

Best, H.S.
