As many of you know I belong to the One Option trading community. I don’t work for them or own any part of the service, I am just a member, an active member, but still just a member. I recommend products and services that I feel are helpful all the time, like TraderSync, TradeXchange or TC2000. If I think it is going to help you, I am going to recommend it. 

**I am especially going to do so if it is free and useful (i.e. Stockbeep.com). That is the case here.**

When Pete (the founder of One Option) told me he was redoing his website and platform (adding a mobile App among other things) I was very interested to see what the result would be as member myself, but also if it would be useful to people. I am a big believer in sharing knowledge, and that one should do so without any desire for profit. The Wiki is an example of that. Although, I don’t hold anything against those that sell their knowledge, service, product, etc – if it truly adds value.  

Which is why I was happy to see that Pete put everything in his head on to the new website, **for free**. Call it the second Wiki if you will.  RTDW could now has two meanings, I guess - Read the damn wiki and read the damn website. The website is [www.oneoption.com](http://www.oneoption.com/) and the new version just launched.   

When you click **Start Here**, it walks you through the entire decision-making process of a trade. Or just go to Go straight to [https://oneoption.com/intro-series/our-trading-methodology/](https://oneoption.com/intro-series/our-trading-methodology/) to access the info. I’ve explained it here a thousand times, but perhaps the way they explain will make more sense to you. I have an ego (shocker, I know), but not so much that I don’t think another perspective might be helpful to some. Hell, Pete developed the method and built an entire trading community around it – I just expanded on it (stand on the shoulders of giants….)

This method can be learned and replicated. I say it over and over – *this is a learned skill*. Read the testimonials on the site and here on this sub-Reddit. Many of these people started out either as new or struggling traders and now make their living doing it full-time. Trading is a real and legitimate career, even better – it offers true financial independence.

There are a lot of other things on the site, i.e. you can also see their chat room from the day before and scroll through the trades posted there and check the time stamps to analyze them. You can see my posts there, which is amazing content itself (see – ego), but more importantly, you can see that it is not just a handful of traders who are coming up with great trade ideas, but rather a lot of people that are successful. 

I’ve said before that if you are going to spend any money make sure it is on a journal first (I recommend TraderSync but that is my preference, there are other good ones as well), but the information laid out on that new site is amazing, cost nothing and you should absolutely take advantage of it.

Best, H.S.
