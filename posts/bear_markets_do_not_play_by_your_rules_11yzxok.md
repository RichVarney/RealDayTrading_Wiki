Everyone has their charts all ready - trendlines drawn, alerts set, everything a successful trader *should* be doing.

And then Powell opens his mouth.  **Support** \- gone. Stock after stock follows the market down and in thirty minutes time previously bullish tickers now look like great shorts.

This happens over and over during a Bear market.  Why?  Why does it fuck with us like that? Why does it ruin our beautiful annotated charts we spend so long making??

**Because that is what a Bear Market does!**

Almost by definition Bear markets are driven by external factors that impact price action.  Bull markets are all about the stocks themselves.  Hell, during an almost decade long Bull run I bet most traders had no idea when the **CPI** was being released, or **jobless numbers.** Nor did we care.  The **FED**? A non-issue.  

Now, every day there is another potential market moving economic release or news story.  

Picture this - you manage hundreds of billions of dollars and you need to somehow put it to work.  Your job is to take all that money and make more of it.  You certainly don't want to lose it. That would be bad.  

So you move it around - one day it is Basic Materials, all the reports say that is the best place to park your money.  So you sell a bunch of your Tech stock (while we sit around wondering why the hell **GOOGL** just went down for seemingly no reason) and move it over.  Powell is raising rates again?  Shit...what are the Treasury notes doing? Can I get 4.5% there?  Damnit Banks are going under....what the fuck people, seriously, What. The. Fuck.  Ok, I am short **KRE** and buying **GOLD**!

It is those billions of dollars that moves the market - and that money is waiting on any sign that there is somewhere safe (and profitable) to invest it.  In a Bull market you could throw a dart hit a stock like **ZM** and go long all day.  You are going to make money in a Bull market, that is a given - but are you going to make more than the other Money Managers out there?  Because that is your focus - beating the other funds.  In a Bear Market though it is just about survival. 

That survival is dependent on all the factors that have lead to the Bear Market in the first place.  Each Bear Market has its own special reason for existing.  Our Bear Market is here because of - **Inflation**. Well at least at first that was the reason.  But now there is a possible **Recession**, maybe **Bank Runs**, there is always threat of **war** expanding, and every now and then the **Covid** pandemic pops back up to remind us that it is still here. 

Each Press Conference, News Release, Economic data drop tells them where they can best *ride out the storm*, and those decisions move the market.  Sometimes they have no fucking clue and we get chop.  Other times they are optimistic that this infernal Bear Market is coming to an end, and everyone wants to be the first to jump in and grab stocks on sale.  Thus, we get a rally.  And other times are *oh fuck* moments, and they all rush to pull their money out of what was previously thought of as "safe" and we get what you saw today - a huge drop.  

Am I saying that Technical Analysis doesn't work in a Bear Market? No - it does.  Just not as well.  The macro-economic environment *must* be taken into account.  Which means as a trader it is your job to learn everything you can about the "Why's" behind the price action you are seeing.  You need to understand what the market is reacting to as well as the magnitude of that reaction.  

Today I was able to take profit in my longs during the initial pop in the market after the FOMC release. I did that because looking at the summary of the report, it became clear that this statement was a lot more hawkish than investors priced in.  That allowed me to not only take profit in those longs, but also increase my short positions.  

While there is a lot to go through when trying to decipher the "Why's" within the socio-economic sphere, I have actually found that ChatGPT can be very helpful in this respect (asking it to explain something to you in the tone of Stephen King is particularly fun).  

I know we normally say, "Just look at the Chart", but these aren't normal times, are they? Fuck no.  So yes, look at the chart - but also look at the news and understand what the hell is going on.  

Just think of all the entertaining knowledge you'll be able to pull out during the next social gathering? Impress your friends! Amaze your family!   

Either way - Learn it.  

Best, H.S.
