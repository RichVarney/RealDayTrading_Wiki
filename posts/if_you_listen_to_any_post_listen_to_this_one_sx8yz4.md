This market right now is most likely chewing you up and spitting you out.  Hell, if you are under the PDT requirements I am seeing it first-hand in the $5K Challenge - it is really hard out there for a swing trader.  

Many of you are discouraged, some at their breaking point even.

But the market really isn't the problem.  

Here is the problem - *When I said it takes two years to do this, it takes* ***two years*** *to do this no matter where you are with your trading experience.*

To put that in perspective - even if you are someone that has been trading for several years, and you started to learn this method from the first day this sub appeared, around 8 months ago - *you wouldn't even be halfway to the point where you should be trading regular positions right now.*

Many of you have simply decided that because you know how to trade, you are just going to switch methods and trade differently.  Most likely you found some success in doing that - certainly it would have improved your win-rate and profit factors.  But that does not mean you are *ready to trade*.  Unless you have three profitable months in a row - *you are not ready to trade*.

You're impatient, I know - you want to make money.  I get it.  But imagine if you did this - 

Every day you watch the market, using the method here find 2-3 trades and make them in a paper trading account.  After the market closes you put those trades in your trading journal and analyze them, note the set-ups, note the mistakes.  At the end of each week, group together your best trades and your worst.  Improve the following week using that information.

At the end of each month, you should be looking at 30-40 trades, you made, but also looking at potential trades you *missed* and why.  You should be examining your exits on those trades (i.e. Walk-Away Analysis) and noting if you exited too early or too late.

Just think where you would be right now if you spent the last six months doing this and never trading a dime of your own money.  How much would you have saved?  How much more knowledge would you have right now as to what works and what doesn't?  

Now imagine doing that for a year, and at the end of that year, beginning to trade 1 Share and/or 1 Contract with real money, increasing to 3-5 trades a day.  And then doing *that* for six months to a year.  All the while, you are figuring out how to avoid the mistakes you are noting, and how to find the set-ups that are profitable.  

Think of how much less stress you would have - the difference would be huge I am sure.

At the end of this process there are two potential outcomes - 

1) You have a win-rate over 75% and a Profit Factor over 2, using 1 Share or 1 Contract

2) You are unable to reach that goal

If it is the second outcome, it tells you that trading is not something you should be doing.  If after two years of practice, dedicated hours each day to study, you still can't hit those levels,  then no, you most likely should not be trading.  

If it is the first outcome, you are now ready to trade and it a far better position to do it than you are right now.

Now consider how far you are from having done that - and you will have the answer to your question and frustration of, "Why can't I get this? No matter what I do I am losing money!"

As I have said, *there is no shortcut.*  The only way to potentially speed up this process is if after 100 Paper Trades you are above those standards listed above, you can move on to the next step of trading 1 Share or 1 Contract without waiting the full year. 

Most of you will not do this, and I get that, I do - it is a long, hard journey.  But unless you are able to string three profitable months together, it is a journey you *need* to take.

Best,

H.S.
