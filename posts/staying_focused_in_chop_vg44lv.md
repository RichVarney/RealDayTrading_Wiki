Let's face it - the past few months have been grueling.

For experienced Day Traders the volatility is exactly what one wants - but most people *aren't* experienced Day Traders - they are either Swing Traders, or those trying to Day Trade - either just starting out or struggling.

But let's first define what we are talking about when I say, "Chop".  Look at Friday's price action on **SPY:**

**That** is chop.  Constant directional changes but in reality you really go....*nowhere*.  There is well-defined ranged after a point; however, this is also *volatile chop* (yes I just made that term up).  *Volatile Chop* is Chop you can't trust - meaning that because the overall market conditions are so erratic, **SPY** could break out of that range at any time, for any reason (especially when there is volume, but more on that in a bit).

Typically with Chop you can play the range, meaning that if you are agile enough, you can day trade either:

**A)** Top of the range, wait for a reversal and short.

**B)** Bottom of the range, wait for a reversal and long.

**C)** Middle of the range, err on the side of your slight bias, go long or short and just wait (this is particularly effective on **S&P** Futures), you will eventually be in profit.

But here is the more infuriating part of Chop - it can wear you down.  You begin to feel like the market is attacking ***you*** personally.  Every trade you make quickly turns against you and then it is a painstaking waiting game for it come back around - and sometimes, even though the market might reverse your stock doesn't.

So you hear the refrain of - "Sit on your hands", "Wait for better conditions".  And that is all well and good, except - what happens when every damn day is Chop?  At some point you need to learn how to trade it or you will be sitting out half the time.

To begin with, even if you have successfully passed the two benchmarks on paper trading and 1-Share trading, if you haven't successfully traded "Chop" you should start again with at least 1-Share.  That way it may still be frustrating but you won't have the added pressure of your account being chopped up as well (see what I did there? "Chopped up...", Yeah...Dad joke on Father's Day...sorry).

In order to focus your mindset you need to understand the story that you are seeing in front of you.  What is Chop?

It is a market that is in a waiting period.  There is no reason for it to go lower than it's current level, nor is there a spark to take it higher.  So instead it forms its' own mini-zones of *Support* and *Resistance*, and moves back and forth within that range.  Just imagine buyers and sellers simply exchanging back and forth, with neither having the upper-hand.   In the Wiki I talked about the *Signal* and the *Noise* \- well, Chop is pure *Noise,* there is no signal.

One thing to note - **Chop with no Volume** is basically Institutions sitting out, and retail traders doing the equivalent of a neighborhood poker game where every week they just exchange the same money back and forth. **Chop with Volume** means that you have an Institutional stand-off, with each side having a reason to be either *bullish or bearish*.  When you see **Chop with Volume** that is where a breakout from the range is more likely to occur.

Knowing what is happening can help keep you focused - because trading Chop requires patience.  In a way, when there is a Choppy market, it is a good time to find stocks with *Relative Strength* and *Relative Weakness*, as they are getting no help from the market.  Now those stocks may be prone to losing their RS/RW intraday, but if you have read the daily chart correctly, and have faith in your thesis - then patience becomes the number one factor that will differentiate a winning trade from a losing one.

If you did the Walk-Away Analysis of trades you made in a Choppy market I am sure you will find a *much higher* profit-factor if you had waited 1-hr and EOD then in non-Choppy markets.

This again comes back to *confidence*, because to have patience in your trade, it means you need to be confident in your thesis, and in order to have that you need to be able to look back at your trading history to see the statistics that should give you that confidence.

What you **do not want to do** is stare at your trade(s) all day - you need to place alerts on the trades you have on for when to take profit and when to close them, and then move on to look at other trades.  Your position size should be low, and thus your current trades should not be taking up so much of your buying power that you can't make other trades if they present themselves.

During chop what you are looking for are **small wins**, you do not want to *average up*, you want small bunt-singles throughout the day.  Conversely your losses should be small as well - so look at the trading range, look at the RS/RW of the Stock - if **AAPL** is at $130, and **SPY** has a wide-range of $360-$370, and you see AAPL moving $1.50 up for every $1 up on SPY, and down .50 for every $1 down on SPY, that still means that AAPL can drop $5 which might not be a drawdown you are willing to hold through.  But if SPY has a narrow range of $363-$367, now you know you can withstand the $2 drop should SPY head to the lower bound for the day.

Days of Chop should have *less trades, smaller position sizes* and your time should be spent creating lists of stocks that should give great set-ups once SPY breaks out either to the upper or lower end of the its' range.  They are perfect days for you to prep during live market conditions - so use the time!  Otherwise you are just staring at SPY going nowhere which is the market equivalent of taking a cold shower.

And let's all hope that we see less Choppy days in the future, because volatility or not, they are annoying as hell.

Best, H.S.
