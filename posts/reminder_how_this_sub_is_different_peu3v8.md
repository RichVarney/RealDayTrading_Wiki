Just a reminder for people and a note for new people joining - this sub-reddit is *very* different than others ones you might have visited.  

We are hyper-focused on one thing - **Teaching people to be** ***consistently*** **profitable at short-term trading.  This means getting the point that you can count on the income at the end of every month and live off those profits.**

There are a number of professional traders here that post and comment - these are people that make their living doing this (and a *very good* living at that).  *No other sub on Reddit has that resource.*  They have been doing it for years and are here to help others.  Keep in mind that they aren't here to argue with someone who has $2,000 in their account, and thinks they know how to trade.

There are a few things that aren't tolerated here, that are allowed elsewhere.  And other things we allow that most forums do not.

*What we* ***do not*** *allow:*

 \- **Cynics**  \- If you do not think Day Trading is viable and you think it is impossible to make money doing this, this sub is **not** for you.  Those comments will be removed and you will be asked to leave. Not because we don't want different opinions, but because that mindset goes against the entire purpose of this community.  It also happens to be wrong.   Chances are you lost money and rather than admit that you screwed up, you would rather claim the entire thing is rigged.  Go talk it out somewhere, get well, and come back.

\- **Bad advice** \-  In other subs it is a free-for-all with everyone throwing out advice on how to trade. It not only leads to confusion amongst new traders, but causes people to make very costly mistakes.  Who judges if the advice is bad? I do. The other professional traders that are mods do as well. We do this for a living and know what works and what does not.  Obviously if there is any grey (gray? grey?) area at all,  it is open to discussion and should be - but there will be no, "SPY is at an all-time high, it is due for a reversal - time to short it!" type posts here.   If you want to counter-trend and pretend you can "beat the market" I assure you that you will wind up broke.

\- **Trolls** \- Zero tolerance. None.  Having an argument is one thing.  Getting frustrated is normal as well (within limits), but if you are clearly just being antagonistic you will be banned permanently.  Asking for proof is also not tolerated.  I did the $30K challenge and opened my account up to be publicly viewed - because that was the best way for people to learn, not to prove anything.  To have professional traders constantly be asked to prove their own livelihood isn't happening here - focus on the advice they are giving. 

\- **Stonks**  \- I do not care how many tendies you have, whether your wife's boyfriend brought home Wendy's, or how many times you've gone "tits up".  Take that shit over to WSB.   If you are seriously using that vernacular (i.e. not saying it sarcastically which is highly recommended) than prepare to be ridiculed, warned and if you can't stop - banned.

*Remember, people come here because they want to learn how to Day Trade* ***for a living****.*  

*This sub will continue to be moderated towards that end.*

There are some things we permit that other subs do not:

*What we* ***do*** *allow:*

*-* **Resources -** most subs will remove any mention of any product or service.  I do not believe in that - I feel that most people aren't "shilling", but rather simply recommending things they have tried.  While I have services, books, and resources I recommend, they aren't the only ones out there and traders should be able to hear what has worked and what hasn't worked for others.  However, if what someone is recommending or selling has no value, or is a clear scam, it will be removed.

\- **No Banned Tickers -** There are no tickers that are banned.  If you want to post about a stock, and you have legitimate technical analysis to give, then by all means, post it.

\- **Live Trading**  \- If you want to set up a chat and trade live with other people, have at it. I would just caution members - *do not blindly follow anyone, including me, into a trade - ever.* If you take a trade, make sure you have your own plan and are not relying on someone else for your exit strategy.

***Always remember the goal here - to learn a skill that can give you financial freedom. If you are using this sub just to get some trade ideas, you are doing yourself a disservice.  The journey to becoming consistently profitable is a long, hard road, but not an impossible one.  Hopefully this forum helps you along the way.***

***Best, H.S.***
