Everyone is trying to predict the bottom.  Retail. Institutions. *Everyone.*

**Why?**

Because nailing the bottom of a Bear Market is without a doubt the single best money making opportunity for a trader/investor.

In the simplest terms - once you know the "bottom" is in, shit goes up.  And usually shit goes up pretty damn fast.

Of course if you start to load up on bullish positions, and the bottom *isn't* in....well, then you're kind of fucked, aren't you?

If for example you think the *Low of the Year* (**SPY $362.17**) is going to hold, and start going Long, but instead it keeps falling, there is still a long way to go before the *actual* *bottom.*  At that point, not only are you down a significant amount of money, but you have also missed the real opportunity.

Thus, while the end of a Bear market presents a great opportunity, is also comes with a lot of risk.

And since we are currently hanging around that Low of the Year mark, many of you might be tempted to start thinking that the next bounce up will be the start of a huge bullish run, or even the beginnings of the next Bull Market.

Let me disillusion you of that idea now -

The only things that can potentially reverse this Bear Market (and I am not referring to the occasional rally, I mean actually *reverse* it) are the following, either in some combination, or through an outstanding result in one of them:

\- **Upcoming Earning Seasons** \- expectations are quite low given the macro-economic environment.  However, if Earnings for the major names (e.g. [**WMT**](https://app.oneoption.com/option-stalker/chart/WMT), [**AAPL**](https://app.oneoption.com/option-stalker/chart/AAPL), [**GOOGL**](https://app.oneoption.com/option-stalker/chart/GOOGL), [**HD**](https://app.oneoption.com/option-stalker/chart/HD), etc...) come in well above expectations - that could certainly have a bullish impact.

\- **CPI or other Inflationary indicators** \- If there is some clear evidence that inflation has not only peaked, but is beginning to decline.

\- **FOMC** \- The fear is that right now the Fed is on track to put us into a Recession, and not only that but, it may actually be their goal.  However, if either due to seeing Economic contraction, a cold CPI report, etc...the Fed decides to ease off on the quantitative tightening and rate hikes, Investors would certainly start to become more eager to begin buying. 

\- **Elections** \- not as big of a factor as the other three, but if something surprising happens like the Democrats win the House and the Senate (they are expected to lose the House and win the Senate), or Republicans win both - that will have an impact, although that impact may be additive or penalizing as a separate market driver on its own.

***Until the market has any or all of the new information listed above, which doesn't really start coming in until Oct/Nov - then any bullish moves you see will be Bear Market Rallies and as such, transient.***

And this doesn't even include anything on the International stage - e.g. a Recession in Europe, Escalation of the Ukrainian war, increasing tensions with China, etc. 

And yes, we all have heard that Bear markets end when Fear is at its' highest - but putting aside the clichés for a moment,  in order for a Bear market to end Institutional investors need to start *buying - a lot.*   And that is not going to happen without substantive information from the four areas listed above.

And why would it?

Would *you* deploy a lot of capital into long-term investments right now only to get whacked with a hot CPI report, or a string of missed expectations on earnings? No, I doubt you would.

Neither would they.

So until then - keep an eye on the *Low of the Year* , if that falls then momentum and/or the lack of any Bulls (i.e., a buyers boycott), might allow the market to drop a significant amount.

On the other side, play any bullish bounces as they will no doubt occur (one of the few times when the notion of being "oversold" actually can apply), but be wary *swinging* during a rally as they can end rather abruptly.

But whatever you do - make sure you have enough cash for when this Bear market actually does end (and it will), because you are going to need it.  Whether through a capitulation low, an extended bottoming process which forms support, or the spark of external news, at some point this Bear market will be finished.

And when that happens you should have your shopping list in hand, because shit will start going up - fast.

Best, H.S.
