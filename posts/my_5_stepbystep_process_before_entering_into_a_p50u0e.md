***Non-Momentum Trades -***

This post is focused on *Non-Momentum* trades - Momentum trades are an integral part of trading, but unfortunately they have become the gateway in which new traders enter the market.  Usually through some video of a guy in a rented Lambo telling you that you can get rich quick.  Variations of the *Gap n' Go* strategy are very difficult to do and only an experienced trader should be doing these types of trades - usually low float, high short, cheap stock.  I set up the sub r/RealDayTrading in order to show traders that one can make a living Day Trading/Swing Trading.  I am focused on helping people with consistently profitable non-momentum trading.

Ok, so how do I find the stocks I trade?  Many of you follow along on my public Tradersync and ask where I found those trades, and what process I use, so here it is:

I am generally alerted to a stock because it either appeared on a constantly running scanner, appeared on a custom scan I just ran or an alert line I had put on the chart was set off - every scanner uses Relative Strength vs. SPY (**Note: This is not RSI or BETA**) as a foundation.

**Step 1:** Everything starts with the market - so that is where I look first.  What is SPY doing?  Is it in a low volume consolidated range, meaning the stock will have to do most of the heavy lifting?  Has it broken any upward or downward trendlines?  Is my trade going with or against the market?  If I am against the market it adds exponentially to the requirements (e.g. shorting against a strong market means the stock needs to be *extremely* weak).  *This is a step I am constantly monitoring and generally already know how the market is doing when I see a stock I like, but it is extremely important so I am putting it here as the first step.*

**Step 2:** I check the daily chart on the stock I was alerted towards - where is major support and resistance levels? Is it approaching an algo line?  Does the stock have a clear bullish or bearish bias on the daily chart - using HA candles and pattern analysis (including how far removed the stock is from its' 8EMA).  What is the relative volume on a daily basis?  *I am looking for a stock with relative volume on the day over 1.5, I want to see two flat bottomed green HA candles on the daily chart, and there should not be any significant resistant (or support if I am shorting) close enough to cause an issue.  Why is the daily chart important?  Because if my Day Trade turns against me, but doesn't violate any of the technical patterns that caused me to enter the trade to begin with, I want to be able to hold the stock until either I hit my target or my thesis for entering is no longer valid.*

**Step 3:** Assuming there is a strong daily chart (meaning this is a stock I wouldn't mind swinging) I am now looking at the 5-minute chart next, with SPY as an overlay.  What is the stock doing compared to SPY? Is there a cross on the TrueStrengthIndex? Is the 3 EMA over the 8EMA?  Is it over VWAP?  Do I need to wait for a pullback or get in now?  *I tend to worry less about entry and more about what my thesis on the stock is based on the technical analysis.  If it is a $100 stock and I believe it is going to $102, than I don't care as much to wait for a pullback - I would rather not risk missing the $2 gain from $100 to $102 if it continues upward.  The 3 over the 8 EMA on the 5 minutes chart is fairly standard, and over VWAP is preferable but not 100% necessary (depending on what it did that morning).  If I have all those things the TSI should confirm it anyway.*

**Step 4:** Is there any catalyst for the stock to be moving right now? This is usually more important with momentum trading, but still something I want to know.  A quick check of various news sites (and sometimes even Twitter is useful, just put a $ in front of the stock symbol and search for latest posts).  How is the sector doing (Finviz is great for a quick visual representation of this).  *This information isn't as important as the first three steps, but if I notice that stock is moving in sympathy with another stock in its sector (for example), I might be more cautious with the trade.*

**Step 5:** What is the best strategy for the trade? I usually trade the stock directly, but what if it is AMZN? My portfolio is strong, but it is not "grab a few hundred shares of AMZN" strong.  If it is options, which options are giving me the best value right now?  Should I use a spread (I Day Trade Call Debit Spreads all the time).  For example on Friday I noticed that **SKIN** was moving up with a strong daily chart, so I bought the stock and sold it for a profit - however, I also saw that next weeks $20 calls were running at parity (i.e. the stock was at $23 and the $20 calls were going for $3), so I bought a bunch of those which I am currently holding.

For Momentum Trades, the volume, the catalyst, float, short %, recent history are all extremely important to know.  If you have your scanners set properly you should be picking up on many of these pre-market and already have this info.  If one pops up during the day, take a breath and still look into each of these pieces of information.

Everyone has their own process and looks at different pieces of information, this is mine - however, all traders should have a process like this to act as a buffer before you jump into a trade.  This process is also a great way to dampen down FOMO, as going through these steps forces you to slow down and take an objective look at trade.

Trade Well!

Best, H.S.
