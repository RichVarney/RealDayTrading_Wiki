Most full-time traders have several accounts, each serving a different purpose and each can be traded differently.

For example, I have:

**Stocks:** This is a long-term account in which I have various stock positions.  Almost all of these positions have come from *selling Puts* and having those Puts exercised.  *Note: I never sell a Put on a stock unless I want to* ***own that stock****.*  The Puts are typically sold from the Day Trading account (where I would keep the premium collected if the trade isn't exercised) and then the stocks are transferred over to this one.  On most positions I will sell OTM Calls (Delta below .10) against the shares each week.  If the shares get called away I sell Puts on them until I have them back.  In this account I will both *average down* and *dollar cost average* on the shares (i.e. I averaged down today on both AMD and AFRM).  Getting the average cost of the shares down and then using the Covered Calls, has this account generating constantly revenue.

**Leaps:** Not every trader has this type of account but in some years it is actually the most profitable.  I will typically have 8 to 10 LEAPS (deep ITM Calls that expire at least a year out) on stocks like **COST**, **SHOP, AMZN, HD, GOOG, etc.**  Every week I am selling OTM calls against the Leap for a *Poor Man's Covered Call* or *Fig Leaf*.  If the stock has an extraordinary good week, the short call gets exercised and is covered by the LEAP, which is a very profitable occurrence.  

**Day Trading:**  This is the main and most active account where most of the trading occurs.  The core balance remains the same and the profit is removed at the end of each month.  Every six months the base amount is increased by 15%.  I've been using this method for the past four years now.

**Challenge Account:** Whether it is the $30K to $60K Challenge, the $5K challenge, or soon to be "$50K - Make a Living" Challenge - this account is kept inactive when there isn't a challenge.

As mentioned, each account is traded differently.   For example, averaging down when Day Trading a stock is typically not a good idea (although there are times when it makes sense) but it may be appropriate in a long-term portfolio.  Closing a trade because of a technical break is the correct move in a Day Trading account, but one will typically ride out those swings for their Long-Term Investments.  The LTI's (Long-Term Investments) can rely on Fundamental Analysis whereas Day/Swing Trades rarely, if ever, take Fundamentals into one's thesis.

Each account is treated differently and operates under its' own set of rules.
