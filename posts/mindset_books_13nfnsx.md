I've read a lot of books on or peripheral to trading, especially mindset related ones. I firmly believe the key from intermediate to pro is mostly about mindset development and so that has been my main focus.I had to grind through a lot of pointless waste of time books that provided me no value. These are the books that stood out and made me a better trader:

&#x200B;

**Thinking Fast and Slow** *Daniel Kahneman*

Nothing specific to trading but helps to understand how the human mind actually decides, and we’re basically training to become professional deciders. The least "special" book on the list but I think it's cool.

&#x200B;

**Market Mind Games** \- *Denise Shull*

Fascinating explanation of the emotional/physical component and how it’s absolutely crucial to making high quality decisions. If you think you need to “remove emotion” from your trading, you need to read this book first.

&#x200B;

**The Hour Between Dog and Wolf** *- John Coates*

The book says it gives solutions but I don’t think it really did. The value came in the actual explanation with what was happening in your body when winning and losing. The hormone feedback loops etc.

&#x200B;

**Thinking in Bets** \- *Annie Duke*

This is a great book to understand what you’re actually doing when you trade. You aren’t trying to “win”, you’re trying to make the most high probability decisions. That completely changes how you analyze your performance and it really helped reshaped how I thought about “mistakes”.

&#x200B;

**Best Loser Wins** \- *Tom Houggard*

This book is the best book on this list. Tom is a real deal futures trader. His strategy might not translate exactly into rs/rw stocks so don’t *literally* do what he says. But he teaches you to be a fearless beast in the markets. This book inspired me to do a mindset challenge that significantly broke a plateau in my trading last December.

&#x200B;

**Trading in the Zone** *Mark Douglas*Aka TITZ the grand daddy of all trading mindset books. Not as much about specific practises or even the science behind it but think of this one as covering all the bases, and really baking in the important mindset points. Everyone says you have to read this one first, but to be honest I didn’t get nearly as much value from it on the first run back in 2021. It was only until I traded RDT for a few months and read the rest of the material that coming back to this one made so much more sense.

&#x200B;

**The Mental Game of Trading** *Jared Tendler*

This one is more of a "course curriculum" about how to identify what your key issues are and systematically start addressing the biggest draws on your profit factor that are mindset based. Think of it like a system to follow or what actions to actually take. I like it, but I think you need to understand the processes behind your mindset first. The Inchworm strategy is gold and how I structure what to focus on.

If you’re wondering how you can read *all* these books? Remember that trading is very hard and takes a lot of time and effort. Once you truly accept that you can feel okay putting in the time. You are capable of much more than you think if something truly urgent and meaningful is on the line. Good luck
