EDIT - this was written roughly a year ago and originally posted in r/daytrading so read it in that context. 

My goal here is simple - I don't want to see people lose money.

Unless you are shilling something (which I am not and never will) there literally is no other reason for someone who does this for a living to come to this Mos Eisley Cantina of Day Trading known as Reddit. I dedicate a certain number of hours a week to help traders because I know how difficult and overwhelming all this can be for someone. The recent 'gold rush' into Day Trading has left a lot of casualties in its path. Every YouTube video and many posts here on Reddit or elsewhere are designed to convince you that Day Trading is easy - it is not. It requires years of hard work to get right.

While I have a lot of posts on Getting Started, Day Trading for a Living, Strategies, Resources, etc...I was asked if I could outline what I feel are the three most important rules for beginners to learn.

These three should be taken in combination with all the other posts I have made - they are in no way the *only three* things you need to know. However, with so much out there to sift through, I do see the valuable in quantifying the three most important (in my opinion).

So here they are:

**1) Don't Anticipate - Confirm** \- This is one of the most common issues I have seen. Everyone wants to catch the move before it happens - i.e. you think SPY is *due* for reversal so you buy Puts or you believe CLOV is going to start going up soon, so you go long. Even more damaging to your portfolio are the amateur economic prognostications such as, "Now that people are going back out to eat, I am going to short DASH". You may well be right, but you need to let the chart confirm those moves before you act. Set alerts, draw trendlines. You think SPY is going to drop? Draw an upward sloping trendline (it will cross around 418.50) and put an alert on it. When SPY drops below that line, then you can look to short it. Chances are not only did you not miss the majority of the move you were looking for, but it most likely just began.

**2) Trade the Chart Not the P&L -** This one is hard, really hard. We are hardwired to focus on how much we are "up" or "down" in a trade. Even if you turn off the P&L, you still know roughly how much money you are making or losing on any particular trade. You need to trade as if you have one share or one contract - make decisions based on your analysis of the price action. This also goes towards position size - if you are exiting a position based on fear than you have too large of a position. If you are just starting out - you need to use *small position sizes until you are consistently profitable.*

**3) Market First, Stock Second -** Always know what the market is doing (SPY/QQQ), are you shorting into a bullish day? Going long into a red day? Is SPY ready to take out the sell stops? Is there chop or a steady trend with volume? Then you need to ask - how the stock performing compared to the market? Is this stock going up while SPY drops? (it doesn't matter if the stock is in the ETF or not) Are both the market and the stock going up but the market is proportionally going up stronger than the stock? The only time these questions aren't as relevant is when you are trading a low float momentum stock that is moving on a catalyst - these equities tends to be independent from the market, but these types of stocks/trades should be a small percentage of your overall trading.

**Remember your overall goal is Consistency.**

You want an effective strategy that you confidently project out each month. I know if I do 400 trades a month, I will make profit on roughly 340-345 of them. I also know what my average amount of profit is per trade (I use rolling annual averages but others go with shorter time frames). Knowing those things mean I can confidently project how much money I will make each month within +/- 3.4% (my current error range around the mean). This allows me to depend on this income the same as I would a salary. At the end of each month I take out the profit and leave the base amount, and every six months I increase the base by roughly 15% (thus, also increasing my month profits). This is only possible if you have an identifiable and repeatable strategy.

Day Trading for a living isn't about how much you made on any one particular day, or trade. It's also not about how much you are "up". It is being able to say you know how much money you will make every month (and thus annually) and being able to count on that amount. If you want to do this for a living everything should be geared towards reaching this goal.

*These three rules aren't all you need to reach it - but in my experience you can't reach this goal without them.*

***Also if there is something in particular you want me to post or elaborate on please let me know. The previous request was a post on Day Trading Options, which I hope was helpful.***
