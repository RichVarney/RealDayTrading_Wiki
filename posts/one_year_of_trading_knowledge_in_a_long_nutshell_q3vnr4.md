Hello traders,

I have been studying day trading for a year now and I wanted to share some of the resources and information that has been most helpful to me on my journey. I am not yet a professional Trader, but I am working towards becoming one.

**Tips / Resources**

**Professional Traders** **-** People like Hari, Pete, and the other professional contributors in this sub who are willing to share their knowledge of the markets, their strategies, and their mistakes have been invaluable mentors to me during my foray into trading. The opportunity to learn from professionals who have spent years honing their skills and studying the market is priceless. They have also made expensive mistakes, and can help us avoid doing the same. If you have not had the chance to read Hari's [How I Got Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/nzxydj/how_i_got_started/) post, I highly recommend you read it along with his other posts.

Hari's roots as a professor really shine through in his posts and methodology - he established a specific goal for this sub, which is  "...to help traders become consistently profitable." Hari then proved that it is possible to be consistently profitable by completing the [30K Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pcx5aj/30k_challenge_complete/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and is currently guiding and educating us as we attempt to become consistent traders as well. **Note:** Following the pros into trades that you do not fully understand because you think it is easy money is a big no-no. You will not learn, you will not become consistent, and you will likely lose money - and it completely defeats the purpose of this sub. That is not to say you should avoid the stocks the pros call out in the chat - rather, you should analyze the stock, form a thesis, plan an entry and exit, and execute the trade - not blindly follow. "How do I close a butterfly?" 20 minutes before close on a Friday should never pop up in the chat. (Also, if you are new here and do not know the chat guidelines, please read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pp1y5m/professionalism_and_chat_etiquette/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).) I invite all of you to find your own trades, ask questions, accept and give constructive criticism, and to be quick to recognize when you are wrong - I personally believe that humility is key to becoming successful in any profession.

**Time In the Market -** No, not the Warren Buffett hold-until-you-die kind; the sit in front of your computer from 7AM to 3PM staring at charts without placing a single trade kind. I do not have a large enough account to day trade frequently, but the time I spend every day learning to read the market and to identify patterns will prove invaluable to me once I do have the capital. Any job requires education and practice - the time I spend in the market learning, observing, and practicing is no different from the time I spend learning in my university classes. Some people call large losses in the stock market "tuition". Personally, I would rather pay my "tuition" in time spent learning than with $$ (though I certainly have paid more $$ than I would like). With time comes the ability to confidently recognize patterns and circumstances that set up great trades. Every day I get a little better at finding strong/weak stocks, recognizing entry and exit points, and knowing the best way to execute a trade. Learning about options spreads and HA charts have helped me make better trades and to stay in winning trades longer/cut losses sooner. Each trader needs to find indicators and methods that work for them, and the only way to do that is to spend significant amounts of time practicing. On a side note, paper trading is *not* a waste of time, nor is it a game. It is a tool that lets you test out strategies like iron condors or long call butterflies without blowing up your account or getting a margin call due to a mistake.

**Google / Other Online Resources -** I felt the need to include Google since I see so many questions on a daily basis that could easily be answered by a quick search. Don't know what a Put Credit Spread is? Google it. look on [OptionsPlaybook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/) or [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-term-dictionary-4769738). You do not need to ask a busy professional trader to define a basic strategy for you when you could do it yourself in seconds. To be frank, if you do not have the capacity or motivation to do the simplest of research, *you* *will not succeed.* You will also lose lots of money. If you enter a trade with minimal research, you could lose more money than you even thought possible (see this example of [Pin Risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipgo2w/tsla_spread_horror_story_professional_advice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). You also need to understand the tax implications of trading, especially how [wash sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsale.asp) work. Your broker probably has an education center that covers the basics of stocks, derivatives, chart reading, etc... TD Ameritrade consistently releases videos that cover not only trading basics, but market conditions, which I have found helpful. Here is a link to their [Trader Education Page](https://www.tdameritrade.com/education/how-to-trade.html) and to their [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCToe3dspZyw2L_JY-JmP3Mw). Pete (u/OptionStalker) also has a [blog](https://www.1option.com/) and a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/OneOption) that have great market commentary/education and trade ideas - I highly recommend watching his videos.

**Setup / Software -** Having a setup that works for you makes finding trades much simpler. I know that Hari currently uses three screens and wants one of [these](https://www.falcontradingsystems.com/trading-computers-John-Carter.html). He uses [TOS](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.html), [OptionStalker](https://www.oneoption.com/), [finviz](https://finviz.com/), TWTR, and [tc2000](https://www.tc2000.com/) (I think that covers it?). I have a laptop and one additional monitor, though I do a significant portion of my research on my phone. I use TOS to place trades both on my phone an on my computer, and I use finviz and TOS to scan for stocks. I also have a long series of watchlists of stocks that I like to trade and stocks that I want to keep an eye on in the RobinHood app. I avoid actually trading on RH, but their app is great for making watchlists and quickly spotting stocks that have RS/RW to the market with the thumbnail charts. I also like the Yahoo Finance app, which has live news and quotes. Finviz and TOS both provide live headlines as well. Setting up commonly used EMAs/SMAs like 3,8,50,100, and 200 is important. Learning how to spot S/R lines and setting up alerts is also essential. I have found that HA candles, ATR and VWAP are also commonly used and effective indicators, which I often pay attention to. I am sure there are many other indicators that work for you that I am not familiar with, and I would love to hear about them and how they have helped you make better trades.

**Strategies -** Trading stocks using the [RS/RW](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/nzxxwj/simple_and_effective_day_trading_method_but/) method is by far the most effective strategy that I know of. It works incredibly well, and is consistently profitable and repeatable. RS/RW is discussed at length throughout this sub. Recently I have been keeping an eye on unusual options activity alerts on Twitter and using the TOS Sizzle Index, which have both highlighted some good trades. The TSLA trade u/Professor1970 posted in the chat today confirmed to me that options sweeps are worth paying attention to. As I mentioned before, using [HA Candles](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/pw0580/using_heikenashi_candles_to_identify_trends_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and learning to trade spreads have been huge milestones for me as well. I think that HA candles complement the RS/RW strategy very nicely and are easy to set up and use. Trading gappers, low float, etc... looks easy, but it is not. I used to think that's what day trading was - I am glad that I have since learned otherwise. I strongly recommend not trading that way, and instead learning RS/RW. Also, trading WSB meme stocks is (usually) a terrible idea. Most of the "fundamental analysis" or "DD" they post is utter nonsense. Some of it is not - but unless you know how to tell the difference, you should stay away. I wouldn't even suggest shorting meme stocks since they only have to be right once for you to be on the wrong side of a short squeeze.

**Mentality -** I have learned to control the adrenaline rush that I used to get while trading, which has made a world of difference. Now when I enter a trade, it just feels like I'm doing any other routine motion. Being calm has made me a much, much better trader. In the (recent) past, I took some unnecessary losses and missed out on some huge gains because I was too afraid or overexcited. Learning to ignore my P&L and trade the chart is still a challenge, but I have gotten better; recently, I have found myself only glancing at my P&L and I no longer feel much of anything. Those P&L numbers are just... more numbers on the screen. The charts are what I *really* care about. That mentality is changing the way I trade and I am seeing the profits come in as a result. Slowly, but consistently.

These posts from Hari are awesome and delve into mentality and habits: [One Question To Ask Yourself Before Making A Trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/pvgpgc/one_question_to_ask_yourself_before_making_a_trade/) and [Bad Trading Habits That Are Causing You To Lose Money](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/q00zz8/bad_trading_habits_that_are_causing_you_to_lose/).

I also loved this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXzJm85mtns&t=186s&ab_channel=TimothySykes) that u/RentalWRLD shared yesterday - it really is worth watching.

I would love to hear what you guys have learned from this sub and for you to share your thoughts and resources. Thank you to Hari for creating this community and to all of you for being a part of it!
