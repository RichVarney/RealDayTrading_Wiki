I've been at this a VERY long time and I am going to share an unfortunate truth. The S&P 500 has rallied more than 100% in less than two years (March 2020). Long term rallies lure many traders into the market and they mask someone's true skill as a trader. There is room for error during these powerful trends and the market forgives mistakes. Poor entry, no problem, the market will come back (and it does). Put credit spreads going against you, no problem, roll it down and out (ha, they expired). They also build a false sense of confidence. When the corrections come (and they will) they wipe out a huge number of traders. Those who only see the long side of the market are lost. They only know how to buy and they keep trying to buy dips like they have successfully done so many times before. Unfortunately, the bounces never come and they lose all of their money. If you do not know how to short, you need to learn. It is an uncomfortable feeling and it takes time to get used to it. Start with 1 share if you have to, but do it. You need to be able to see both sides of the coin. That perspective will help you with all of your trading. We are going to see two-sided action this year and it is unreasonable to expect performance like we have seen in the last two years.
